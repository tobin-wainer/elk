	abstract = {The central brightness cusps seen in some globular clusters are thought 
to be the relics of a gravothermal core collapse that occurred sometime
in the clusters' past. Recent observations show that the centers of such
clusters are bluer than their outskirts, indicating that the stellar
populations there are somehow different than those farther out,
presumably as a result of unusual physical processes that took place in
these extremely dense regions. Here I analyze a large body of digital
imagery from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Hubble Space
Telescope to obtain color-magnitude and color-color diagrams for stars
in the central two arcminutes of the prototypical core-cusp globular
cluster M15 = NGC 7078 = C 2127 + 119. These data were reduced with a
new computer program, named ALLFRAME, that is described in detail here
for the first time. ALLFRAME makes simultaneous use of the geometric and
photometric information from all images of a given field to derive a
self-consistent set of positions and magnitudes for all detected
starlike objects in that area of sky, thereby extending the range of
magnitude and crowding conditions for which useful photometry is
obtainable. I tentatively conclude that the color gradient in M15 is due
to three distinct effects: (1) there is a deficiency of the brightest
red giants in the central regions of the cluster; (2) the giant branch
of the dominant cluster population shifts systematically toward the blue
as the center of the cluster is approached; and (3) the very center of
the cluster (radius approximately equal or less than 12 seconds)
contains a large population of blue and yellow stragglers that occupy
the area of the color-magnitude diagram between the main-sequence
turnoff and the horizontal branch and between the extended blue
horizontal branch and the subgiant branch; many of these appear to have
a significant ultraviolet excess.},

	abstract = {Context. The Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) located in the inner regions of the Milky Way suffer from high extinction that makes their observation challenging. High densities of field stars in their surroundings complicate their study even more. The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey provides a way to explore these GGCs in the near-infrared where extinction effects are highly diminished. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We conduct a search for variable stars in several inner GGCs, taking advantage of the unique multi-epoch, wide-field, near-infrared photometry provided by the VVV survey. We are especially interested in detecting classical pulsators that will help us constrain the physical parameters of these GGCs. In this paper, the second of a series, we focus on NGC 6656 (M 22), NGC 6626 (M 28), NGC 6569, and NGC 6441; these four massive GGCs have known variable sources, but quite different metallicities. We also revisit 2MASS-GC 02 and Terzan 10, the two GGCs studied in the first paper of this series. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We present an improved method and a new parameter that efficiently identify variable candidates in the GGCs. We also use the proper motions of those detected variable candidates and their positions in the sky and in the color-magnitude diagrams to assign membership to the GGCs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We identify and parametrize in the near-infrared numerous variable sources in the studied GGCs, cataloging tens of previously undetected variable stars. We recover many known classical pulsators in these clusters, including the vast majority of their fundamental mode RR Lyrae. We use these pulsators to obtain distances and extinctions toward these objects. Recalibrated period-luminosity-metallicity relations for the RR Lyrae bring the distances to these GGCs to a closer agreement with those reported by Gaia, except for NGC 6441, which is an uncommon Oosterhoff III GGC. Recovered proper motions for these GGCs also agree with those reported by Gaia, except for 2MASS-GC 02, the most reddened GGC in our sample, where the VVV near-infrared measurements provide a more accurate determination of its proper motions. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Lightcurves and full Tables 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/651/A47"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/651/A47{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

In particular, the analysis of the discs and of the exoplanets around young stars allows us to know the key processes that prevail in their evolution and understand the properties of the exoplanets orbiting older stars. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission is giving us the opportunity to extract and analyse the light curves of association members with high accuracy, but the crowding that affects these regions makes difficult the light curve extraction. In the PATHOS project, cutting-edge tools are used to extract high-precision light curves and identify variable stars and transiting exoplanets in open clusters and associations. In this work, I analysed the light curves of stars in five young (≲10 Myr) associations, searching for variables and candidate exoplanets. Using the rotational periods of the association members, I constrained the ages of the five stellar systems ({\textasciitilde}2-10 Myr). I searched for dippers, and I investigated the properties of the dust that forms the circumstellar discs. Finally, I searched for transiting signals, finding six strong candidate exoplanets. No candidates with radius RP ≲ 0.9 RJ have been detected, in agreement with the expectations. The frequency of giant planets resulted to be {\textasciitilde}2-3 per cent, higher than that expected for field stars (≲ 1 per cent); the low statistic makes this conclusion not strong, and new investigations on young objects are mandatory to confirm this result.},

Of these, more than 2200 have known periods and the majority (approximately 1800) are of the RR Lyrae type. In addition to the RR Lyrae population, there are approximately 100 eclipsing binaries, 120 SX Phoenicis variables, 60 Cepheids (including Population II Cepheids, anomalous Cepheids and RV Tauri), and 120 SR/red variables. The mean period of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables is 0.585 days, for the overtone variables it is 0.342 days (0.349 days for the first-overtone pulsators and 0.296 days for the second-overtone pulsators) and approximately 30\% are overtone pulsators. These numbers indicate that about 65\% of RR Lyrae variables in Galactic globular clusters belong to Oosterhoff type I systems. The mean period of the RR Lyrae variables in the Oosterhoff type I clusters seems to be correlated with metal abundance in the sense that the periods are longer in the more metal poor clusters. Such a correlation does not exist for the Oosterhoff type II clusters. Most of the Cepheids are in clusters with blue horizontal branches.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, asteroseismology has increasingly proven to be the observational tool of choice for the study of stellar physics, aided by the high quality of data available from space-based missions such as CoRoT, Kepler, K2, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TESS in particular will produce more than an order of magnitude more such data than has ever been available before. While the standard TESS mission products include light curves from 120 s observations suitable for both exoplanet and asteroseismic studies, they do not include light curves for the vastly larger number of targets observed by the mission at a longer 1800 s cadence in Full Frame Images (FFIs). To address this lack, the TESS Data for Asteroseismology (T'DA) group under the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium (TASC) has constructed an open-source pipeline focused on producing light curves for all stars observed by TESS at all cadences, currently including stars down to a TESS magnitude of 15. The pipeline includes target identification, background estimation and removal, correction of FFI time stamps, and a range of potential photometric extraction methodologies, though aperture photometry is currently the default approach. For the brightest targets, we transparently apply a halo photometry algorithm to construct a calibrated light curve from unsaturated pixels in the image. In this paper, we describe in detail the algorithms, functionality, and products of this pipeline and summarize the noise metrics for the light curves. Companion papers will address the removal of systematic noise sources from our light curves, and a stellar variability classification from these.},

	abstract = {Long-period variable stars arise in the final stages of the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. They have periods of up to about 1,000 days and amplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the I-band flux. These stars pulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode, which is a function of mass and radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of the underlying stellar population. The overall number of long-period variables in a population is directly related to their lifetimes, which is difficult to predict from first principles because of uncertainties associated with stellar mass-loss and convective mixing. The time variability of these stars has not previously been taken into account when modelling the spectral energy distributions of galaxies. Here we construct time-dependent stellar population models that include the effects of long-period variable stars, and report the ubiquitous detection of this expected ‘pixel shimmer’ in the massive metal-rich galaxy M87. The pixel light curves display a variety of behaviours. The observed variation of 0.1 to 1 per cent is very well matched to the predictions of our models. The data provide a strong constraint on the properties of variable stars in an old and metal-rich stellar population, and we infer that the lifetime of long-period variables in M87 is shorter by approximately 30 per cent compared to predictions from the latest stellar evolution models.},

While light curves will be provided for ∼400,000 targets observed at 2 minute cadence, observations of most stars will only be provided as full-frame images (FFIs) at 30 minute cadence. The TESS image scale of ∼21″/pix is highly susceptible to crowding, blending, and source confusion, and the highly spatially variable point-spread function (PSF) will challenge traditional techniques, such as aperture and Gaussian-kernel PSF photometry. We use official “End-to-End 6” TESS simulated FFIs to demonstrate a difference image analysis pipeline, using a δ-function kernel, that achieves the mission specification noise floor of 60 ppm hr-1/2. We show that the pipeline performance does not depend on position across the field, and only ∼2\% of stars appear to exhibit residual systematics at the level of ∼5 ppt. We also demonstrate recoverability of planet transits, eclipsing binaries, and other variables. We provide the pipeline as an open-source tool at https://github.com/ryanoelkers/DIA in both IDL and PYTHON. We intend to extract light curves for all point sources in the TESS FFIs as soon as they become publicly available, and will provide the light curves through the Filtergraph data visualization service.

Here we present the first application of asteroseismology to the problem of stellar obliquity determination in systems with transiting planets and Sun-like host stars. We consider two systems observed by the NASA Kepler mission which have multiple transiting small (super-Earth sized) planets: the previously reported Kepler-50 and a new system, Kepler-65, whose planets we validate in this paper. Both stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations. From the asteroseismic analysis we find that each host has its rotation axis nearly perpendicular to the line of sight with the sines of the angles constrained at the 1σ level to lie above 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. We use statistical arguments to show that coplanar orbits are favored in both systems, and that the orientations of the planetary orbits and the stellar rotation axis are correlated.},

	abstract = {We present a catalog of stellar properties for a large sample of 6676 evolved stars with Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment spectroscopic parameters and Kepler asteroseismic data analyzed using five independent techniques. Our data include evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them. We employ a new empirical approach for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing (Δν) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero-point of the frequency of the maximum power (ν max) relation to be consistent with masses and radii for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines are in much better agreement than would be expected from the pipeline-predicted random errors, but 22\% of them had at least one method not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators is consistent with our error model, which yields median random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\%. Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\% level, respectively, for red clump stars.},

	abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will search for planets transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

	abstract = {The majority of observed pixels on the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) are delivered in the form of full-frame images (FFIs). However, the FFIs contain systematic effects such as pointing jitter and scattered light from the Earth and Moon that must be removed (i.e., "detrended") before downstream analysis. We present unpopular, an open-source Python package to obtain detrended TESS FFI light curves optimized for variable sources. The unpopular package implements a variant of the causal pixel model to remove systematics and allows for simultaneous fitting with a polynomial component to capture nontransit astrophysical variations, such as supernova signals or stellar variability, that tend to be removed in techniques optimized for exoplanet detection. We validate our method by detrending different sources (e.g., supernovae, tidal disruption events (TDEs), exoplanet-hosting stars, fast-rotating stars) and comparing our light curves to those obtained by other pipelines when appropriate. Our supernova and TDE light curves are visually similar to those obtained by others using the ISIS image subtraction package, indicating that unpopular can be used to extract multisector light curves by preserving astrophysical signals on timescales of a TESS sector ({\textasciitilde}27 days). We note that our method contains tuning parameters that are currently set heuristically, and that the optimal set of tuning parameters will likely depend on the particular signal the user is interested in obtaining.
