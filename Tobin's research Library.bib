	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data,
using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a
two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only
appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have
negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be
described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in
practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily
covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad
data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected
intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize
the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate
one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary
because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the
parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a
posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance
parameters" to marginalize away.},

	abstract = {We analyze the luminosity function of the globular clusters (GCs) belonging to the early-type galaxies observed in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey. We have obtained estimates for a Gaussian representation of the GC luminosity function (GCLF) for 89 galaxies. We have also fit the GCLFs with an "evolved Schechter function", which is meant to reflect the preferential depletion of low-mass GCs, primarily by evaporation due to two-body relaxation, from an initial Schechter mass function similar to that of young massive clusters. We find a significant trend of the GCLF dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sense that smaller galaxies have narrower GCLFs. We show that this narrowing of the GCLF in a Gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the GC mass function above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. We argue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the GC mass function is most likely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster mass function. The GCLF turnover mass M\_TO is roughly constant, at {\textasciitilde} 2.2 x 10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with M\_B {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} -18. We show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamical friction timescales in smaller galaxies. We probe the variation of the GCLF to projected galactocentric radii of 20-35 kpc in the Virgo giants M49 and M87, finding that M\_TO is essentially constant over these spatial scales. Our fits of evolved Schechter functions imply average dynamical mass losses (Delta) over a Hubble time that fall in the range 2 x 10{\textasciicircum}5 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} (Delta/M\_sun) {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}6 per GC. We agree with previous suggestions that if the full GCLF is to be understood in more detail GCLF models will have to include self-consistent treatments of dynamical evolution inside time-dependent galaxy potentials.

	abstract = {Aims: The initial cluster mass function (ICMF) in spiral discs is constrained and compared with data for old globular clusters and young clusters in starbursts. Methods: For a given absolute magnitude, the cluster age distribution depends on the ICMF. Here, the behaviour of the median age-magnitude relation is analysed in detail for Schechter ICMFs with various cut-off masses, M\_c. The calculated relations are compared with observations of the brightest clusters in spiral galaxies. Schechter functions are also fitted directly to observed mass functions (MFs). Results: A single Schechter ICMF with an Mc of a few times 105 M⊙ can reproduce the observed ages and luminosities of the brightest (and 5th brightest) clusters in the spirals if disruption of optically visible clusters is dominated by relatively slow secular evolution. A Schechter function fit to the combined cluster MF for all spirals in the sample yields Mc = (2.1±0.4)×105 M⊙. The MFs in
cluster-poor and cluster-rich spirals are statistically
indistinguishable. An Mc = 2.1×105
M⊙ Schechter function also fits the MF of young clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. If the same ICMF applies in the Milky Way, a bound cluster with M {\textgreater} 105 M⊙ will
form about once every 107 years, while an M {\textgreater}
106 M⊙ cluster will form only once every 50 Gyr. Luminosity functions (LFs) of model cluster populations drawn from an Mc = 2.1×105 M⊙ Schechter
ICMF generally agree with LFs observed in spiral galaxies. Conclusions: The ICMF in present-day spiral discs can be modelled as a Schechter function with Mc ≈ 2×105
M⊙. However, the presence of significant numbers of M {\textgreater} 106 M⊙ (and even M {\textgreater} 107
M⊙) clusters in some starburst galaxies makes it unlikely that the Mc value derived for spirals is universal. In high-pressure environments, such as those created by complex gas kinematics and feedback in mergers, Mc can shift to higher masses than in quiescent discs.},

	abstract = {We present a series of simple, largely analytical models to compute the effects of disruption on the mass function of star clusters. Our calculations include evaporation by two-body relaxation and gravitational shocks and mass loss by stellar evolution. We find that, for a wide variety of initial conditions, the mass function develops a turnover or peak and that, after 12 Gyr, this is remarkably close to the observed peak for globular clusters, at Mp ≈ 2 × 105 M☉. Below the peak, the evolution is dominated by two-body relaxation, and the mass function always develops a tail of the form ψ(M) = const, reflecting that the masses of tidally limited clusters decrease linearly with time just before they are destroyed. This also agrees well with the empirical mass function of globular clusters in the Milky Way. Above the peak, the evolution is dominated by stellar evolution at early times and by gravitational shocks at late times. These processes shift the mass function to lower masses, while nearly preserving its shape. The radial variation of the mass function within a galaxy depends on the initial position-velocity distribution of the clusters. We find that some radial anisotropy in the initial velocity distribution, especially when this increases outward, is needed to account for the observed near-uniformity of the mass functions of globular clusters. This may be consistent with the observed near-isotropy of the present velocity distributions, because clusters on elongated orbits are preferentially destroyed. These results are based on models with static, spherical galactic potentials. We point out that there would be even more radial mixing of the orbits and hence more uniformity of the mass function if the galactic potentials were time-dependent and/or nonspherical.},

samples of four galaxies, M51, M33, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and
the solar neighbourhood. If the disruption time of clusters in a galaxy
depends only on their initial mass as tdis(yr)
=t4dis(Mcl/104
Msolar)γ, and if the cluster formation rate
is constant, then the mass and age distributions of the observed
clusters will each be given by double power-law relations. For clusters
of low mass or young age the power law depends on the fading of the
clusters below the detection limit due to the evolution of the stars.
For clusters of high mass and old age the power law depends on the
disruption time of the clusters. The samples of clusters in M51 and M33,
observed with HST-WFPC2, indeed show the predicted double power-law
relations in both their mass and age distributions. The values of
tdis4 and γ can be derived from
these relations. For the cluster samples of the SMC and the solar
neighbourhood, taken from the literature, only the age distribution is
known. This also shows the characteristic double power-law behaviour,
which allows the determination of tdis4
and γ in these galaxies. The values of γ are the same in the
four galaxies within the uncertainty, and the mean value is γ=
0.62 +/- 0.06. However, the disruption time
tdis4 of a cluster of 104
Msolar is very different in the different galaxies. The
clusters in the SMC have the longest disruption time,
tdis4{\textasciitilde}= 8 × 109 yr,
and the clusters at 1-3 kpc from the nucleus of M51 have the shortest
disruption time of tdis4{\textasciitilde}= 4 ×

These new observations are the deepest and highest resolution images ever taken of a grand-design spiral, particularly in the near-ultraviolet, and allow us to better differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars and to measure the luminosities of even faint clusters in the U band. We find that the luminosity function (LF) for clusters outside of the very crowded starburst nucleus can be approximated by a power law, dN/dL ∝ L α, with α = –2.04 ± 0.08, down to MV ≈ –5.5. We test the sensitivity of the LF to different selection techniques, filters, binning, and aperture correction determinations, and find that none of these contribute significantly to uncertainties in α. We estimate ages and masses for the clusters by comparing their measured UBVI, Hα colors with predictions from single stellar population models. The age distribution of the clusters can be approximated by a power law, dN/dτ ∝ τγ, with γ = –0.9 ± 0.2, for M ≳ few × 103 M ☉ and τ ≲ 4 × 108 yr. This indicates that clusters are disrupted quickly, with ≈80\%-90\% disrupted each decade in age over this time. The mass function of clusters over the same M-τ range is a power law, dN/dM ∝ M β, with β = –1.94 ± 0.16, and does not have bends or show curvature at either high or low masses.

This power law is inconsistent with standard dispersal mechanisms such as cluster evaporation and cloud collisions. In the conventional interpretation, it requires the unlikely situation where diverse mechanisms stitch together over time in a way that is independent of environment or M. Here, we consider another model in which the large-scale distribution of gas in each star-forming region plays an important role. We note that star clusters form with positional and temporal correlations in giant cloud complexes, and suggest that these complexes dominate the tidal force and collisional influence on a cluster during its first several hundred million years. Because the cloud complex density decreases regularly with position from the cluster birth site, the harassment and collision rates between the cluster and the cloud pieces decrease regularly with age as the cluster drifts. This decrease is typically a power law of the form required to explain the mass-age distribution. We reproduce this distribution for a variety of cases, including rapid disruption, slow erosion, combinations of these two, cluster-cloud collisions, cluster disruption by hierarchical disassembly, and partial cluster disruption. We also consider apparent cluster mass loss by fading below the surface brightness limit of a survey. In all cases, the observed log M-log T diagram can be reproduced under reasonable assumptions.},

	abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge
concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M⊙. Moreover, observations of
nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

	abstract = {We present a simple analytical description of the disruption of star 
clusters in a tidal field. The cluster disruption time, defined as
t\_dis= \{d ln M/dt\}-1, depends on the mass M of the cluster
as t\_dis=t\_0(M/M⊙)γ with γ=0.62
for clusters in a tidal field, as shown by empirical studies of cluster
samples in different galaxies and by N-body simulations. Using this
simple description we derive an analytic expression for the way in which
the mass of a cluster decreases with time due to stellar evolution and
disruption. The result agrees very well with those of detailed N-body
simulations for clusters in the tidal field of our galaxy. The analytic
expression can be used to predict the mass and age histograms of
surviving clusters for any cluster initial mass function and any cluster
formation history. The method is applied to explain the age distribution
of the open clusters in the solar neighbourhood within 600 pc, based on
a new cluster sample that appears to be unbiased within a distance of
about 1 kpc. From a comparison between the observed and predicted age
distributions in the age range between 10 Myr to 3 Gyr we find the
following results: (1) The disruption time of a 104
M⊙ cluster in the solar neighbourhood is about 1.3
± 0.5 Gyr. This is a factor of 5 shorter than that derived from
N-body simulations of clusters in the tidal field of the galaxy.
Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. (2) The present
star formation rate in bound clusters within 600 pc of the Sun is 5.9
± 0.8 × 102 M⊙ Myr-1,
which corresponds to a surface star formation rate of bound clusters of
5.2 ± 0.7 × 10-10 M⊙
yr-1 pc-2. (3) The age distribution of open
clusters shows a bump between 0.26 and 0.6 Gyr when the cluster
formation rate was 2.5 times higher than before and after. (4) The
present star formation rate in bound clusters is about half that derived
from the study of embedded clusters. The difference suggests that about
half of the clusters in the solar neighbourhood become unbound within
about 10 Myr. (5) The most massive clusters within 600 pc had an initial
mass of about 3× 104 M⊙. This is in
agreement with the statistically expected value based on a cluster
initial mass function with a slope of -2, even if the physical upper
mass limit for cluster formation is as high as 106
M⊙.},

young star cluster (YSC) catalogs for a significant fraction of galaxies
observed with the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) Hubble treasury
program. We present the methodology developed to extract cluster
positions, verify their genuine nature, produce multiband photometry
(from NUV to NIR), and derive their physical properties via spectral
energy distribution fitting analyses. We use the nearby spiral galaxy
NGC 628 as a test case for demonstrating the impact that LEGUS will have
on our understanding of the formation and evolution of YSCs and compact
stellar associations within their host galaxy. Our analysis of the
cluster luminosity function from the UV to the NIR finds a steepening at
the bright end and at all wavelengths suggesting a dearth of luminous
clusters. The cluster mass function of NGC 628 is consistent with a
power-law distribution of slopes ∼ -2 and a truncation of a few
times 105 \{M\}⊙ . After their formation, YSCs
and compact associations follow different evolutionary paths. YSCs
survive for a longer time frame, confirming their being potentially
bound systems. Associations disappear on timescales comparable to
hierarchically organized star-forming regions, suggesting that they are
expanding systems. We find mass-independent cluster disruption in the
inner region of NGC 628, while in the outer part of the galaxy there is
little or no disruption. We observe faster disruption rates for low mass
(≤104 \{M\}⊙ ) clusters, suggesting that a
mass-dependent component is necessary to fully describe the YSC
disruption process in NGC 628.

	abstract = {There is much debate on how high-mass star formation varies with environment, and whether the sparsest star-forming environments are capable of forming massive stars. To address this issue, we have observed eight apparently isolated OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys. Five of these objects appear as isolated stars, two of which are confirmed to be runaways. The remaining three objects are found to exist in sparse clusters, with lsim10 companion stars revealed, having masses of 1-4 M sun. Stochastic effects dominate in these sparse clusters, so we perform Monte Carlo simulations to explore how our observations fit within the framework of empirical, galactic cluster properties. We generate clusters using a simplistic -2 power-law distribution for either the number of stars per cluster (N *) or cluster mass (M cl). These clusters are then populated with stars randomly chosen from a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). We find that simulations with cluster lower-mass limits of M
cl,lo {\textgreater}= 20 M sun and N *,lo {\textgreater}= 40 match best with observations of SMC and Galactic OB star populations. We examine the mass ratio of the second most massive and most massive stars m max,2/m max, finding that our observations all exist below the 20th percentile of our simulated clusters. However, all of our observed clusters lie within the parameter space spanned by the simulated clusters, although some are in the lowest 5th percentile frequency. These results suggest that clusters are built stochastically by randomly sampling stars from a universal IMF with a fixed stellar upper-mass limit. In particular, we see no evidence to suggest an m max-M cl relation. Our results may be more consistent with core accretion models of star formation than with competitive accretion models, and they are inconsistent with the proposed steepening of the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF).},

	abstract = {Whether or not the initial star cluster mass function is established 
through a universal, galactocentric-distance-independent stochastic
process, on the scales of individual galaxies, remains an unsolved
problem. This debate has recently gained new impetus through the
publication of a study that concluded that the maximum cluster mass in a
given population is not solely determined by size-of-sample effects.
Here, we revisit the evidence in favor and against stochastic cluster
formation by examining the young (≲ a few × \{10\}8
year old) star cluster mass-galactocentric radius relation in M33,
M51, M83, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. To eliminate size-of-sample
effects, we first adopt radial bin sizes containing constant numbers of
clusters, which we use to quantify the radial distribution of the first-
to fifth-ranked most massive clusters using ordinary least-squares
fitting. We supplement this analysis with an application of quantile
regression, a binless approach to rank-based regression taking an
absolute-value-distance penalty. Both methods yield, within the 1σ
to 3σ uncertainties, near-zero slopes in the diagnostic plane,
largely irrespective of the maximum age or minimum mass imposed on our
sample selection, or of the radial bin size adopted. We conclude that,
at least in our four well-studied sample galaxies, star cluster
formation does not necessarily require an environment-dependent cluster
formation scenario, which thus supports the notion of stochastic star
cluster formation as the dominant star cluster-formation process within
a given galaxy.},

simulations, we confirm this result and link the shape of the luminosity
function to the presence of a truncation in the mass function. A mass

little variation in the shape of the mass function at masses above 1

the galaxy between radii of 0.45 and 4.5 kpc. We aim to probe the
properties of the cluster population as a function of distance from the
galactic centre. We observe a net decline in cluster formation
efficiency (Γ, i.e. amount of star formation happening in bound
clusters) from about 26 per cent in the inner region to 8 per cent in
the outer part of the galaxy. The recovered Γ values within
different regions of M83 follow the same Γ versus star formation
rate density relation observed for entire galaxies. We also probe the
initial cluster mass function (ICMF) as a function of galactocentric
distance. We observe a significant steepening of the ICMF in the outer
regions (from -1.90 ± 0.11 to -2.70 ± 0.14) and for the
whole galactic cluster population (slope of -2.18 ± 0.07) of M83.
We show that this change of slope reflects a more fundamental change of
the `truncation mass' at the high-mass end of the distribution. This can
be modelled as a Schechter function of slope -2 with an exponential
cutoff mass (Mc) that decreases significantly from the inner
to the outer regions (from 4.00 to 0.25 × 105
M⊙) while the galactic Mc is ≈1.60 ×
105 M⊙. The trends in Γ and ICMF are
consistent with the observed radial decrease of the
Σ(H2), hence in gas pressure. As gas pressure declines,
cluster formation becomes less efficient. We conclude that the host
galaxy environment appears to regulate (1) the fraction of stars locked
in clusters and (2) the upper mass limit of the ICMF, consistently
described by a near-universal slope -2 truncated at the high-mass end.},

	abstract = {We study the stellar cluster population in two adjacent fields in the 
nearby, face-on spiral galaxy M83 using multiwavelength Wide Field
Camera 3/Hubble Space Telescope imaging. After automatic detection
procedures, the clusters are selected through visual inspection to be
centrally concentrated, symmetric, and resolved on the images, which
allows us to differentiate between clusters and likely unbound
associations. We compare our sample with previous studies and show that
the differences between the catalogues are largely due to the inclusion
of a large numbers of diffuse associations within previous catalogues as
well as the inclusion of the central starburst region, where the
completeness limit is significantly worse than in the surrounding
regions. We derive the size distribution of the clusters, which is well
described by a lognormal distribution with a peak at ∼2.5 pc, and
find evidence for an expansion in the half-light radius of clusters with
age. The luminosity function of the clusters is well approximated by a
power law with an index of -2 over most of the observed range; however,
a steepening is seen at MV=-9.3 and -8.8 in the inner and
outer fields, respectively. Additionally, we show that the cluster
population is inconsistent with a pure power-law mass distribution, but
instead exhibits a truncation at the high-mass end. If described as a
Schechter function, the characteristic mass is 1.6 ×
105 and 0.5 × 105 M⊙ for the
inner and outer fields, respectively, in agreement with previous
estimates of other cluster populations in spiral galaxies. Comparing the
predictions of the mass-independent disruption (MID) and mass-dependent
disruption (MDD) scenarios with the observed distributions, we find that
both models can accurately fit the data. However, for the MID case, the
fraction of clusters destroyed (or mass lost) per decade in age is
dependent on the environment; hence, the age and mass distributions of
clusters are not universal. In the MDD case, the disruption time-scale
scales with galactocentric distance (being longer in the outer regions
of the galaxy) in agreement with analytic and numerical predictions.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on other
extragalactic surveys, focusing on the fraction of stars that form in
clusters and the need (or lack thereof) for infant mortality.},

	abstract = {We further the recent discussion on the relation between the star 
formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy and the luminosity of its brightest
star cluster (SFR versus MbrightestV). We first
show that the observed trend of SFR versus
MbrightestV is due to the brightest cluster in a
galaxy being preferentially young ({\textless}=15 Myr - for a constant SFR) and
hence a good tracer of the current SFR, although we give notable
exceptions to this rule. Archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging
of high-SFR galaxies, as well as additional galaxies/clusters from the
literature, is used to further confirm the observed trend. Using a
series of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a pure power-law mass
function with index α = 2 is ruled out by the current data.
Instead, we find that a Schechter function (i.e. a power law with an
exponential truncation at the high-mass end) provides an excellent fit
to the data. Additionally, these simulations show that bound cluster
formation (in Msolaryr-1) represents only {\textasciitilde}8+/-3 per cent of
the total star formation within a galaxy, independent of the SFR. From
this, we conclude that there is only a single mode of cluster formation
which operates over at least 6 orders of magnitude in the SFR. We
provide a simple model of star/cluster formation feedback within dwarf
galaxies (and star-forming complexes within spirals) which highlights
the strong impact that a massive cluster can have on its surroundings.

Using this relation, we can extrapolate backwards in time in order to
estimate the peak SFR of major merger galaxies, such as NGC 7252,1316
and 3610. The derived SFRs for these galaxies are between a few hundred
and a few thousand solar masses per year. The inferred far-infrared
luminosity of the galaxies, from the extrapolated SFR, places them well
within the range of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and for NGC
7252 within the hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HLIRG) regime. Thus, we
provide evidence that these post-merger galaxies passed through a
ULIRG/HLIRG phase and are now evolving passively. Using the current and
extrapolated past SFR of NGC 34, we infer that the ULIRG phase of this
galaxy has lasted for at least 150 Myr.},

	abstract = {We present a simple, self-consistent model to predict the maximum masses 
of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), stellar clusters and high-redshift
clumps as a function of the galactic environment. Recent works have
proposed that these maximum masses are set by shearing motions and
centrifugal forces, but we show that this idea is inconsistent with the
low masses observed across an important range of local-Universe
environments, such as low-surface density galaxies and galaxy outskirts.
Instead, we propose that feedback from young stars can disrupt clouds
before the global collapse of the shear-limited area is completed. We
develop a shear-feedback hybrid model that depends on three observable
quantities: the gas surface density, the epicylic frequency and the
Toomre parameter. The model is tested in four galactic environments: the
Milky Way, the Local Group galaxy M31, the spiral galaxy M83 and the
high-redshift galaxy zC406690. We demonstrate that our model
simultaneously reproduces the observed maximum masses of GMCs, clumps
and clusters in each of these environments. We find that clouds and
clusters in M31 and in the Milky Way are feedback-limited beyond radii
of 8.4 and 4 kpc, respectively, whereas the masses in M83 and zC406690
are shear-limited at all radii. In zC406690, the maximum cluster masses
decrease further due to their inspiral by dynamical friction. These
results illustrate that the maximum masses change from being
shear-limited to being feedback-limited as galaxies become less gas rich
and evolve towards low shear. This explains why high-redshift clumps are
more massive than GMCs in the local Universe.},

	abstract = {Star clusters stand at the intersection of much of modern astrophysics: the ISM, gravitational dynamics, stellar evolution, and cosmology. Here, we review observations and theoretical models for the formation, evolution, and eventual disruption of star clusters. Current literature suggests a picture of this life cycle including the following several phases: Clusters form in hierarchically structured, accreting molecular clouds that convert gas into stars at a low rate per dynamical time until feedback disperses the gas. The densest parts of the hierarchy resist gas removal long enough to reach high star-formation efficiency, becoming dynamically relaxed and well mixed. These remain bound after gas removal. In the first ∼100 Myr after gas removal, clusters
disperse moderately fast, through a combination of mass loss and tidal shocks by dense molecular structures in the star-forming environment. After ∼100 Myr, clusters lose mass via two-body relaxation and
shocks by giant molecular clouds, processes that preferentially affect low-mass clusters and cause a turnover in the cluster mass function to appear on ∼1-10-Gyr timescales. Even after dispersal, some clusters remain coherent and thus detectable in chemical or action space for multiple galactic orbits.In the next decade, a new generation of space- and adaptive optics-assisted ground-based telescopes will enable us to test and refine this picture.},

a high-mass truncation: only 15 clusters more massive than
\{10\}4 \{M\}⊙ are observed, compared to the
∼100 expected for a canonical \{M\}-2 pure power-law mass
function with the same total number of clusters above the catalog
completeness limit. Adopting a Schechter function parameterization, we
fit a characteristic truncation mass of
\{M\}c=\{8.5\}-1.8+2.8×
\{10\}3 M ⊙. Although previous studies have
measured cluster mass function truncations, the characteristic
truncation mass we measure is the lowest ever reported. Combining this
M31 measurement with previous results, we find that the cluster mass
function truncation correlates strongly with the characteristic star
formation rate surface density of the host galaxy, where
\{M\}c{\textbackslash}propto {\textless} \{\{\{Σ \}\}\}\{SFR\}\{\vphantom{\}}{\textgreater}

In the same area, there are 630 YSCCs that we identified using Spitzer-24 μm data. Some YSCCs are embedded star-forming sites, while the majority have GALEX-UV and Hα counterparts with estimated cluster masses and ages. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The GMC classes correspond to different cloud evolutionary stages: inactive clouds are 32\% of the total and classified clouds with embedded and exposed star formation are 16\% and 52\% of the total, respectively. Across the regular southern spiral arm, inactive clouds are preferentially located in the inner part of the arm, possibly suggesting a triggering of star formation as the cloud crosses the arm. The spatial correlation between YSCCs and GMCs is extremely strong, with a typical separation of 17 pc. This is less than half the CO (2-1) beam size and illustrates the remarkable physical link between the two populations. GMCs and YSCCs follow the HI filaments, except in the outermost regions, where the survey finds fewer GMCs than YSCCs, which is most likely due to undetected clouds with low CO luminosity. The distribution of the non-embedded YSCC ages peaks around 5 Myr, with only a few being as old as 8-10 Myr. These age estimates together with the number of GMCs in the various evolutionary stages lead us to conclude that 14 Myr is the typical lifetime of a GMC in M 33 prior to cloud dispersal. The inactive and embedded phases are short, lasting about 4 and 2 Myr, respectively. This underlines that embedded YSCCs rapidly break out from the clouds and become partially visible in Hα or UV long before cloud dispersal.

At large galactocentric radii, the paucity of luminous clusters and the relevance of hot dust emission become evident from the analysis of the bolometric and MIR luminosity functions. The YSC mass and size are correlated with a log-log slope of 2.09 ± 0.01, similar to that measured for giant molecular clouds in M 33 and the Milky Way, which represent the protocluster environment.

We derive the ages and masses using a probabilistic technique, which accounts for the eﬀects of stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function. Tests on synthetic data show that this method, in conjunction with the exquisite sensitivity of the PHAT observations and their broad wavelength baseline, provides robust age and mass recovery for clusters ranging from ∼ 102 − 2 × 106 M⊙. We ﬁnd that the cluster age distribution is consistent with being uniform over the past 100 Myr, which suggests a weak eﬀect of cluster disruption within M31. The age distribution of older ({\textgreater} 100 Myr) clusters fall towards old ages, consistent with a power-law decline of index −1, likely from a combination of fading and disruption of the clusters. We ﬁnd that the mass distribution of the whole sample can be well-described by a single power-law with a spectral index of −1.9 ± 0.1 over the range of 103 − 3 × 105 M⊙. However, if we subdivide the sample by galactocentric radius, we ﬁnd that the age distributions remain unchanged. However, the mass spectral index varies signiﬁcantly, showing best ﬁt values between −2.2 and −1.8, with the shallower slope in the highest star formation intensity regions. We explore the robustness of our study to potential systematics and conclude that the cluster mass function may vary with respect to environment.},

	abstract = {We present the implementation of a Bayesian formalism within the Stochastically Lighting Up Galaxies (SLUG) stellar population synthesis code, which is designed to investigate variations in the initial mass function (IMF) of star clusters. By comparing observed cluster photometry to large libraries of clusters simulated with a continuously varying IMF, our formalism yields the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) of the cluster mass, age, and extinction, jointly with the parameters describing the IMF. We apply this formalism to a sample of star clusters from the nearby galaxy NGC 628, for which broad-band photometry in five filters is available as part of the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). After allowing the upper-end slope of the IMF (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_3\$) to vary, we recover PDFs for the mass, age, and extinction that are broadly consistent with what is found when assuming an invariant Kroupa IMF. However, the posterior PDF for \${\textbackslash}alpha\_3\$ is very broad due to a strong degeneracy with the cluster mass, and it is found to be sensitive to the choice of priors, particularly on the cluster mass. We find only a modest improvement in the constraining power of \${\textbackslash}alpha\_3\$ when adding H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ photometry from the companion H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-LEGUS survey. Conversely, H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ photometry significantly improves the age determination, reducing the frequency of multi-modal PDFs. With the aid of mock clusters we quantify the degeneracy between physical parameters, showing how constraints on the cluster mass that are independent of photometry can be used to pin down the IMF properties of star clusters.},

They found that there is a very good relation between the flux ratio of L\_\{8510\}/L\_\{9170\} and the metallicity for stellar populations older than 1 Gyr. In this paper, based on the Kong et al. results and on the multicolor spectrophotometry of Ma et al.

The results show that most of these old clusters are metal poor. We also find that the ages and metal abundance for these old star clusters of M33 do not vary with deprojected radial position.

We show that, without prior knowledge on the metallicity, the optical bands (UBVRI) fail to allow a correct derivation of the age, mass, and extinction because of the strong degeneracies between models of different metallicities. Adding near-infrared information (UBVRI+JHK) slightly helps in improving the parameter derivation, except for the metallicity. Adding ultraviolet data (GALEX+UBVRI) helps significantly in deriving these parameters and allows constraining the metallicity when the photometric errors have a Gaussian distribution with standard deviations 0.05 mag for UBVRI and 0.15 mag for the GALEX bands.},

We measure Γ of 4\%–8\% for young, 10–100 Myr-old populations in M31. We find that cluster formation efficiency varies systematically across the M31 disk, consistent with variations in mid-plane pressure. These Γ measurements expand the range of well-studied galactic environments, providing precise constraints in an H i-dominated, low-intensity star formation environment. Spatially resolved results from M31 are broadly consistent with previous trends observed on galaxy-integrated scales, where Γ increases with increasing star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR). However, we can explain observed scatter in the relation and attain better agreement between observations and theoretical models if we account for environmental variations in gas depletion time (τ dep) when modeling Γ, accounting for the qualitative shift in star formation behavior when transitioning from a H2-dominated to a H i-dominated interstellar medium. We also demonstrate that Γ measurements in high ΣSFR starburst systems are well-explained by τ dep-dependent fiducial Γ models.},

	abstract = {We present a new catalog of star cluster candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy M33. It is based on eight existing catalogs wherein we have cross-referenced identifications and endeavored to resolve inconsistencies between them. Our catalog contains 451 candidates, of which 255 are confirmed clusters based on Hubble Space Telescope and high-resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog contains precise cluster positions (right ascension and declination), magnitudes and colors in the UBVRIJHKS filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with major peaks at (B - V)0 {\textasciitilde} 0.15 and (B - V)0 {\textasciitilde} 0.65. The intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 107.5 to 1010.3 yr. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of α = -1.09 ± 0.07 in the dNclus/dτ ∝ τα relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity relation among these clusters, with younger clusters being more metal-rich. Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that younger clusters (age lesssim1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33 field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater than 99.9\% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and discussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more complete and thorough cluster search is needed, covering at least 4 deg2 centered on M33.},

In this catalog, the authors listed star clusters’ parameters such as cluster positions, magnitudes, colors in the UBVRIJHKs filters, and so on. However, a large fraction of objects in this catalog do not have previously published photometry. Photometry is performed using archival images from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 0.8 deg2 along the major axis of M33. Detailed comparisons show that, in general, our photometry is consistent with previous measurements. Positions (right ascension and declination) for some clusters are corrected here. Combined with previous literature, ours constitute a large sample of M33 star clusters. Based on this cluster sample, we present some statistical results: none of the youngest M33 clusters (∼107 yr) have masses approaching 105 M ☉; roughly half the star clusters are consistent with the 104-105 M ☉ mass models; the continuous distribution of star clusters along the model line indicates that M33 star clusters have been formed continuously from the epoch of the first star cluster formation until recent times; and there are ∼50 star clusters which are overlapped with the Galactic globular clusters on the color-color diagram, and these clusters are old globular cluster candidates in M33.},

We present ugriz integrated magnitudes of the candidates and confirmed star clusters (SCs) as well as the full width at half maximum, ellipticity, and stellarity. Based on the properties of the confirmed SCs, we select a sub-sample of highly probable clusters composed of 246 objects. The integrated photometry of the complete cluster catalog reveals a wide range of colors of –0.4 {\textless} (g – r) {\textless} 1.5 and –1.0 {\textless} (r – i) {\textless} 1.0 with no obvious cluster subpopulations. Comparisons with models of simple stellar populations suggest a large range of ages some as old as ∼10 Gyr. In addition, we find a sequence in the color-color diagrams that deviates from the expected direction of evolution. This feature could be associated with very young clusters ({\textless}107 yr) possessing significant nebular emission. Analysis of the radial density distribution suggests that the cluster system of M33 has suffered from significant depletion possibly due to interactions with M31. We also detect a gap in the cluster distribution in the color-color diagram at (g – r) ≃ 0.3 and (u – g) ≃ 0.8. This gap could be interpreted as an evolutionary effect. This complete catalog provides promising targets for deep photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy to study the structure and star formation history of M33.},

Our photometry includes 387, 563, 616, 580, and 478 objects in the UBVRI bands, respectively, of which 276, 405, 430, 457, and 363 do not have previously published UBVRI photometry. Our photometry is consistent with previous measurements (where available) in all filters. We adopted Sloan Digital Sky Survey ugriz photometry for complementary purposes, as well as Two Micron All Sky Survey near-infrared JHK photometry where available. We fitted the spectral-energy distributions of 671 star clusters and candidates to derive their ages, metallicities, and masses based on the updated PARSEC simple stellar populations synthesis models. The results of our χ2 minimization routines show that only 205 of the 671 clusters (31\%) are older than 2 Gyr, which represents a much smaller fraction of the cluster population than that in M31 (56\%), suggesting that M33 is dominated by young star clusters ({\textless}1 Gyr). We investigate the mass distributions of the star clusters—both open and globular clusters—in M33, M31, the Milky Way, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their mean values are log (M cl/M ☉) = 4.25, 5.43, 2.72, and 4.18, respectively. The fraction of open to globular clusters is highest in the Milky Way and lowest in M31. Our comparisons of the cluster ages, masses, and metallicities show that our results are basically in agreement with previous studies (where objects in common are available); differences can be traced back to differences in the models adopted, the fitting methods used, and stochastic sampling effects.},

We combine the classical 1/Vmax approach with STY, a parametric maximum likelihood method and SWML, a non-parametric maximum likelihood technique. In the parametric approach, we are assuming that the stellar mass function can be modelled by either a single or a double Schechter function and we use a likelihood ratio test to determine which model provides a better fit to the data. We discuss how the stellar mass completeness as a function of z biases the three estimators and how it can affect, especially the low mass end of the stellar mass function. We apply our method to SDSS DR7 data in the redshift range from 0.02 to 0.06. We find that the entire galaxy sample is best described by a double Schechter function with the following parameters: \${\textbackslash}log (M{\textasciicircum}\{*\}/M\_{\textbackslash}odot) = 10.79 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$, \${\textbackslash}log ({\textbackslash}Phi{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\_1/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}) = -3.31 {\textbackslash}pm 0.20\$, \${\textbackslash}alpha\_1 = -1.69 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10\$, \${\textbackslash}log ({\textbackslash}Phi{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\_2/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}) = -2.01 {\textbackslash}pm 0.28\$ and \${\textbackslash}alpha\_2 = -0.79 {\textbackslash}pm 0.04\$.

	abstract = {This contribution addresses the question of whether the initial cluster mass function (ICMF) has a fundamental limit (or truncation) at high masses. The shape of the ICMF at high masses can be studied using the most massive young ({\textless}10 Myr) clusters, however this has proven diﬃcult due to low-number statistics. In this contribution we use an alternative method based on the luminosities of the brightest clusters, combined with their ages. The advantages are that more clusters can be used and that the ICMF leaves a distinct pattern on the global relation between the cluster luminosity and median age within a population. If a truncation is present, a generic prediction (nearly independent of the cluster disruption law adopted) is that the median age of bright clusters should be younger than that of fainter clusters. In the case of an non-truncated ICMF, the median age should be independent of cluster luminosity. Here, we present optical spectroscopy of twelve young stellar clusters in the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 2997. The spectra are used to estimate the age of each cluster, and the brightness of the clusters is taken from the literature. The observations are compared with the model expectations of Larsen (2009, A\&A, 494, 539) for various ICMF forms and both mass dependent and mass independent cluster disruption. While there exists some degeneracy between the truncation mass and the amount of mass independent disruption, the observations favour a truncated ICMF. For low or modest amounts of mass independent disruption, a truncation mass of 5−6 × 105 M is estimated, consistent with previous determinations. Additionally, we investigate possible truncations in the ICMF in the spiral galaxy M 83, the interacting Antennae galaxies, and the collection of spiral and dwarf galaxies present in Larsen (2009, A\&A, 494, 539) based on photometric catalogues taken from the literature, and ﬁnd that all catalogues are consistent with having a truncation in the cluster mass functions. However for the case of the Antennae, we ﬁnd a truncation mass of a few ×106 M , suggesting a dependence on the environment, as has been previously suggested.},

	abstract = {We study the stellar cluster population in two adjacent ﬁelds in the nearby, face-on spiral galaxy M83 using multiwavelength Wide Field Camera 3/Hubble Space Telescope imaging. After automatic detection procedures, the clusters are selected through visual inspection to be centrally concentrated, symmetric, and resolved on the images, which allows us to differentiate between clusters and likely unbound associations. We compare our sample with previous studies and show that the differences between the catalogues are largely due to the inclusion of a large numbers of diffuse associations within previous catalogues as well as the inclusion of the central starburst region, where the completeness limit is signiﬁcantly worse than in the surrounding regions. We derive the size distribution of the clusters, which is well described by a lognormal distribution with a peak at ∼2.5 pc, and ﬁnd evidence for an expansion in the halflight radius of clusters with age. The luminosity function of the clusters is well approximated by a power law with an index of −2 over most of the observed range; however, a steepening is seen at MV = −9.3 and −8.8 in the inner and outer ﬁelds, respectively. Additionally, we show that the cluster population is inconsistent with a pure power-law mass distribution, but instead exhibits a truncation at the high-mass end. If described as a Schechter function, the characteristic mass is 1.6 × 105 and 0.5 × 105 M for the inner and outer ﬁelds, respectively, in agreement with previous estimates of other cluster populations in spiral galaxies. Comparing the predictions of the mass-independent disruption (MID) and mass-dependent disruption (MDD) scenarios with the observed distributions, we ﬁnd that both models can accurately ﬁt the data. However, for the MID case, the fraction of clusters destroyed (or mass lost) per decade in age is dependent on the environment; hence, the age and mass distributions of clusters are not universal. In the MDD case, the disruption time-scale scales with galactocentric distance (being longer in the outer regions of the galaxy) in agreement with analytic and numerical predictions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on other extragalactic surveys, focusing on the fraction of stars that form in clusters and the need (or lack thereof) for infant mortality.},

	abstract = {We present the results of an analysis of the HST-WFPC2 observations of 
the interacting galaxy M 51. From the observations in 5 broadband
filters (UBVRI) and two narrowband filters (Hα and [OIII]) we
study the cluster population in a region of 3.2 x 3.2 kpc2 in
the inner spiral arms of M 51, at a distance of about 1 to 3 kpc from
the nucleus. We found 877 cluster candidates and we derived their ages,
initial masses and extinctions by means of a comparison between the
observed spectral energy distribution and the predictions from cluster
synthesis models for instantaneous star formation and solar metallicity.
The lack of [OIII] emission in even the youngest clusters with strong
Hα emission, indicates the absence of the most massive stars and
suggests a mass upper limit of about 25 to 30 Msun. The mass
versus age distribution of the clusters shows a drastic decrease in the
number of clusters with age, much more severe than can be expected on
the basis of evolutionary fading of the clusters. This indicates that
cluster dispersion is occurring on a timescale of 10 Myr or longer. The
cluster initial mass function has been derived from clusters younger
than 10 Myr by a linear regression fit of the cumulative mass
distribution. This results in an exponent alpha = -d log N(M) /d log (M)
= 2.1 +/- 0.3 in the range of 2.5x 103 {\textless} M {\textless} 5x
104 M{\textbackslash}odot but with an overabundance of clusters
with M {\textgreater} 2x 104 Msun. In the restricted range
of 2.5x 103 {\textless} M {\textless} 2x 104 Msun we
find alpha = 2.0 +/- 0.05. This exponent is very similar to the value
derived for clusters in the interacting Antennae galaxies, and to the
exponent of the mass distribution of the giant molecular clouds in our
Galaxy. To study the possible effects of the interaction of M 51 with
its companion NGC 5195 about 400 Myr ago, which triggered a huge
starburst in the nucleus, we determined the cluster formation rate as a
function of time for clusters with an initial mass larger than
104 Msun. There is no evidence for a peak in the
cluster formation rate at around 200 to 400 Myr ago within 2 sigma
accuracy, i.e. within a factor two. The formation rate of the detected
clusters decreases strongly with age by about a factor 102
between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr. For clusters older than about 150 Myr this is
due to the evolutionary fading of the clusters below the detection
limit. For clusters younger than 100 Myr this is due to the dispersion
of the clusters, unless one assumes that the cluster formation rate has
been steadily increasing with time from 1 Gyr ago to the present time.

	abstract = {The Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Near Infrared Camera and 
Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) have been used to obtain new Hubble
Space Telescope images of NGC 4038/4039 ("The Antennae"). These new
observations allow us to better differentiate compact star clusters from
individual stars, based on both size and color. We use this ability to
extend the cluster luminosity function (LF) by approximately 2 mag over
our previous WFPC2 results, and find that it continues as a single power
law, dN/dL vprop L α with α = -2.13 ±
0.07, down to the observational limit of MV ≈ -7.
Similarly, the mass function (MF) is a single power law dN/dM vprop M
β with β = -2.10 ± 0.20 for clusters with
ages {\textless}3 × 108 yr, corresponding to lower mass limits
that range from 104 to 105 M sun,
depending on the age range of the subsample. Hence, the power-law
indices for the luminosity and MFs are essentially the same. The LF for
intermediate-age clusters (i.e., {\textasciitilde}100-300 Myr old objects found in the
loops, tails, and outer areas) shows no bend or turnover down to
MV ≈ -6, consistent with relaxation-driven cluster
disruption models which predict the turnover should not be observed
until MV ≈ -4. An analysis of individual {\textasciitilde}0.5 kpc sized
areas over diverse environments shows good agreement between values of
α and β, similar to the results for the total population of
clusters in the system. There is tentative evidence that the values of
both α and β are flatter for the youngest clusters in some
areas, but it is possible that this is caused by observational biases.
Several of the areas studied show evidence for age gradients, with
somewhat older clusters appearing to have triggered the formation of
younger clusters. The area around Knot B is a particularly interesting
example, with a {\textasciitilde}10-50 Myr old cluster of estimated mass {\textasciitilde}106
M sun having apparently triggered the formation of several
younger, more massive (up to 5 × 106 M sun)
clusters along a dust lane. A comparison with new NICMOS observations
reveals that only 16\% ± 6\% of the IR-bright clusters in the
Antennae are still heavily obscured, with values of AV {\textgreater}3
mag.

We, then, move beyond the Local Group to review star cluster populations at various evolutionary stages, and in diverse galactic environmental conditions accessible in the local Universe. At high redshift, where conditions for cluster formation and evolution are more extreme, we are only able to observe the integrated light of a handful of objects that we believe will become globular clusters.

the galaxy between radii of 0.45 and 4.5 kpc. We aim to probe the
properties of the cluster population as a function of distance from the
galactic centre. We observe a net decline in cluster formation
efficiency (Γ, i.e. amount of star formation happening in bound
clusters) from about 26 per cent in the inner region to 8 per cent in
the outer part of the galaxy. The recovered Γ values within
different regions of M83 follow the same Γ versus star formation
rate density relation observed for entire galaxies. We also probe the
initial cluster mass function (ICMF) as a function of galactocentric
distance. We observe a significant steepening of the ICMF in the outer
regions (from -1.90 ± 0.11 to -2.70 ± 0.14) and for the
whole galactic cluster population (slope of -2.18 ± 0.07) of M83.
We show that this change of slope reflects a more fundamental change of
the `truncation mass' at the high-mass end of the distribution. This can
be modelled as a Schechter function of slope -2 with an exponential
cutoff mass (Mc) that decreases significantly from the inner
to the outer regions (from 4.00 to 0.25 × 105
M⊙) while the galactic Mc is ≈1.60 ×
105 M⊙. The trends in Γ and ICMF are
consistent with the observed radial decrease of the
Σ(H2), hence in gas pressure. As gas pressure declines,
cluster formation becomes less efficient. We conclude that the host
galaxy environment appears to regulate (1) the fraction of stars locked
in clusters and (2) the upper mass limit of the ICMF, consistently
described by a near-universal slope -2 truncated at the high-mass end.},

Here, we present a cloud-based analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(1 → 0) observations of M83 to search for such a truncation mass in the molecular cloud population. We identify a population of 873 molecular clouds in M83 that is largely similar to those found in the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies, though clouds in the centre of the galaxy show high surface densities and enhanced turbulence, as is common for clouds in
high-density nuclear environments. Like the young massive clusters, we find a maximum-mass scale for the molecular clouds which decreases radially in the galaxy. We find that the most young massive cluster tracks the most massive molecular cloud with the cluster mass being 10-2 times that of the most massive molecular cloud. Outside the nuclear region of M83 (Rg {\textgreater} 0.5 kpc), there is no evidence for changing internal conditions in the population of molecular clouds, with the average internal pressures, densities and free-fall times remaining constant for the cloud population over the galaxy. This result is consistent with the bound cluster formation efficiency depending only on the large-scale properties of the interstellar medium rather than the internal conditions of individual clouds.},

the full posterior distributions of the parameters describing star
cluster demographics. We demonstrate the method using mock star cluster
catalogues and show that our method is robust and accurate, and that it
can recover the demographics of star cluster populations significantly
better than traditional fitting methods. For realistic sample sizes, our
method is sufficiently powerful that its accuracy is ultimately limited
by the accuracy of the underlying physical models for stellar evolution

Conversely, accurate deductions of the properties of such objects also

suite of modular, open-source software tools for tackling these related
problems. These include the following: a greatly-enhanced version of the
SLUG code introduced by da Silva et al., which computes spectra and
photometry for stochastically or deterministically sampled stellar
populations with nearly arbitrary star formation histories, clustering
properties, and initial mass functions; CLOUDY\_SLUG, a tool that
automatically couples SLUG-computed spectra with the CLOUDY radiative
transfer code in order to predict stochastic nebular emission;
BAYESPHOT, a general-purpose tool for performing Bayesian inference on
the physical properties of stellar systems based on unresolved
photometry; and CLUSTER\_SLUG and SFR\_SLUG, a pair of tools that use
BAYESPHOT on a library of SLUG models to compute the mass, age, and
extinction of mono-age star clusters, and the star formation rate of
galaxies, respectively. The latter two tools make use of an extensive

for selected pointings of 50 galaxies within the local 12 Mpc. The

F555W(λ5308 Å), and F814W(λ8024 Å) the
parallel observations with the ACS use the filters F435W(λ4328
Å), F606W(λ5921 Å), and F814W(λ8057 Å).
The multiband images are yielding accurate recent (≲50 Myr) star
formation histories from resolved massive stars and the
extinction-corrected ages and masses of star clusters and associations.
The extensive inventories of massive stars and clustered systems will be
used to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of star formation
within galaxies. This will, in turn, inform theories of galaxy evolution
and improve the understanding of the physical underpinning of the
gas-star formation relation and the nature of star formation at high
redshift. This paper describes the survey, its goals and observational
strategy, and the initial scientific results. Because LEGUS will provide
a reference survey and a foundation for future observations with the
James Webb Space Telescope and with ALMA, a large number of data
products are planned for delivery to the community.

This code produces many useful outputs, including (1) catalogs of star clusters and their properties such as their stellar initial mass distributions and their photometric properties in a variety of filters, (2) two dimensional histograms of color-magnitude diagrams of every star in the simulation, and (3) the photometric properties of field stars and the integrated photometry of the entire simulated galaxy. After presenting the SLUG algorithm in detail, we validate the code through comparisons with STARBURST99 in the well-sampled regime, and with observed photometry of Milky Way clusters.

	abstract = {Population III (pop III) galaxies, made partly or exclusively of 
metal-free stars, are predicted to exist at high redshifts and may
produce very strong Lyα emission. A substantial fraction of these
Lyα photons are likely absorbed in the intergalactic medium at z
{\textgreater} 6, but recent simulations suggest that significant Lyα
emission may be detectable up to z≈ 8.5, i.e. well into the
reionization epoch. Here, we argue that high-redshift pop III galaxies
with strong Lyα emission can be identified in Hubble Space
Telescope imaging data because of their unusual colours. We quantify
this effect in some of the filters used in Y-band dropout searches for
galaxies at z≈ 8 and find that pop III galaxies with high Lyα
fluxes may exhibit much bluer J-H colours at z≈ 8-10 than any normal
type of galaxy at these redshifts. This colour signature can arise even
if pop III stars account for as little as ∼10-3 to
10-2 of the stellar mass in these galaxies. Some of the
anomalously blue objects reported in current Y-band dropout samples do
in fact meet the colour criteria for Lyα-emitting pop III
galaxies.},

cluster formation rate and no disruption of the most massive clusters it
also means that M max increases linearly with age when
determining M max in logarithmic age bins. We observe this
increase in five out of the seven galaxies in our sample, suggesting
that M max is determined by the size of the sample. It also
means that massive clusters are very stable against disruption, in
disagreement with the mass-independent disruption (MID) model. For the
clusters in M51 and the Antennae galaxies, the size-of-sample prediction
breaks down around 106 M⊙, suggesting that
this is a physical upper limit to the masses of star clusters in these
galaxies. In this method there is a degeneracy between MID and a CIMF
truncation. We show how the cluster luminosity function can serve as a
tool to distinguish between the two.},

present-day power-law stellar mass function (MF) of a resolved young
star cluster. This technique (1) fully exploits the information content
of a given data set; (2) can account for observational uncertainties in
a straightforward way; (3) assigns meaningful uncertainties to the
inferred parameters; (4) avoids the pitfalls associated with binning
data; and (5) can be applied to virtually any resolved young cluster,
laying the groundwork for a systematic study of the high-mass stellar MF
(M {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1 M ⊙). Using simulated clusters and Markov
Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions, we
show that estimates of the MF slope, α, are unbiased and that the
uncertainty, Δα, depends primarily on the number of observed
stars and on the range of stellar masses they span, assuming that the
uncertainties on individual masses and the completeness are both well
characterized. Using idealized mock data, we compute the theoretical
precision, i.e., lower limits, on α, and provide an analytic
approximation for Δα as a function of the observed number of
stars and mass range. Comparison with literature studies shows that {\textasciitilde}3/4
of quoted uncertainties are smaller than the theoretical lower limit. By
correcting these uncertainties to the theoretical lower limits, we find
that the literature studies yield langαrang = 2.46, with a
1σ dispersion of 0.35 dex. We verify that it is impossible for a
power-law MF to obtain meaningful constraints on the upper mass limit of
the initial mass function, beyond the lower bound of the most massive
star actually observed. We show that avoiding substantial biases in the
MF slope requires (1) including the MF as a prior when deriving
individual stellar mass estimates, (2) modeling the uncertainties in the
individual stellar masses, and (3) fully characterizing and then
explicitly modeling the completeness for stars of a given mass. The
precision on MF slope recovery in this paper are lower limits, as we do
not explicitly consider all possible sources of uncertainty, including
dynamical effects (e.g., mass segregation), unresolved binaries, and
non-coeval populations. We briefly discuss how each of these effects can
be incorporated into extensions of the present framework. Finally, we
emphasize that the technique and lessons learned are applicable to more
general problems involving power-law fitting.

Stochastically Lighting Up Galaxies (slug) code, to derive the masses,

Unlike many analysis methods, slug correctly accounts for incomplete
initial mass function (IMF) sampling, and returns full posterior
probability distributions rather than simply probability maxima. We
apply our technique to 621 visually confirmed clusters in two nearby
galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 7793, that are part of the Legacy
Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). LEGUS provides Hubble Space Telescope
photometry in the NUV, U, B, V, and I bands. We analyze the sensitivity
of the derived cluster properties to choices of prior probability
distribution, evolutionary tracks, IMF, metallicity, treatment of
nebular emission, and extinction curve. We find that slug's results for
individual clusters are insensitive to most of these choices, but that
the posterior probability distributions we derive are often quite broad,
and sometimes multi-peaked and quite sensitive to the choice of priors.
In contrast, the properties of the cluster population as a whole are
relatively robust against all of these choices. We also compare our
results from slug to those derived with a conventional non-stochastic
fitting code, Yggdrasil. We show that slug's stochastic models are
generally a better fit to the observations than the deterministic ones
used by Yggdrasil. However, the overall properties of the cluster
populations recovered by both codes are qualitatively similar.},

	abstract = {The initial sizes and masses of massive star clusters provide information about the cluster formation process and also determine how cluster populations are modified and destroyed, which have implications for using clusters as tracers of galaxy assembly. Young massive cluster populations are often assumed to be unchanged since cluster formation, and therefore their distribution of masses and radii are used as the initial values. However, the first few hundred million years of cluster evolution does change both cluster mass and cluster radius, through both internal and external processes. In this paper, we use a large suite of \$N\$-body cluster simulations in an appropriate tidal field to determine the best initial mass and initial size distributions of young clusters in the nearby galaxy M83. We find that the initial masses follow a power-law distribution with a slope of -2.7 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.4, and the half-mass radii follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of 2.57 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.04 pc and a dispersion of 1.59 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.01 pc. The corresponding initial projected half-light radius function has a mean of 2.7 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.3 pc and a dispersion of 1.7 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.2 pc. The evolution of the initial mass and size distribution functions are consistent with mass loss and expansion due to stellar evolution, independent of the external tidal field and the cluster's initial density profile. Observed cluster sizes and masses should not be used as the initial values, even when clusters are only a few hundred million years old.},

This approach circumvents the limitations of the empirical two-point correlation function analysis by naturally accounting for the inhomogeneity present in the distribution of YSCCs. We also investigate the effects of GMCs' properties on their spatial distributions. We confirm that the distribution of GMCs and YSCCs are highly correlated. We found that the spatial distributions of YSCCs reaches a peak of clustering pattern at {\textasciitilde}250 pc scale compared to a Poisson process. This clustering mainly occurs in regions where the galactocentric distance {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}4.5 kpc. Furthermore, the galactocentric distance of GMCs and their mass have strong positive effects on the correlation strength between GMCs and YSCCs.

cosmological simulations plays a critical role in shaping galaxy
properties. In the first paper of the series, we presented a new method
to model star formation as a collection of star clusters. In this paper,
we improve the algorithm by eliminating accretion gaps, boosting
momentum feedback, and introducing a subgrid initial bound fraction, f
 i , that distinguishes cluster mass from stellar particle
mass. We perform a suite of simulations with different star formation
efficiency per freefall time \{ɛ \vphantom{\{}\}ff\} and supernova
momentum feedback intensity \{f\vphantom{\{}\}boost\}. We find that the star
formation history of a Milky Way-sized galaxy is sensitive to
\{f\vphantom{\{}\}boost\}, which allows us to constrain its value,
\{f\vphantom{\{}\}boost\}≈ 5, in the current simulation setup. Changing
\{ɛ \vphantom{\{}\}ff\} from a few percent to 200\% has little effect on
global galaxy properties. However, on smaller scales, the properties of
star clusters are very sensitive to \{ɛ \vphantom{\{}\}ff\}. We find
that f i increases with \{ɛ \vphantom{\{}\}ff\} and cluster
mass. Through the dependence on f i , the shape of the
cluster initial mass function varies strongly with \{\vphantom{\}}ɛ
\vphantom{\{}\}ff\vphantom{\{}\}. The fraction of clustered star formation and maximum
cluster mass increase with the star formation rate surface density, with
the normalization of both relations dependent on \{\vphantom{\}}ɛ
\vphantom{\{}\}ff\vphantom{\{}\}. The cluster formation timescale systematically
decreases with increasing \{ɛ \vphantom{\{}\}ff\}. Local variations in
the gas accretion history lead to a 0.25 dex scatter for the integral
cluster formation efficiency. Joint constraints from all the observables
prefer the runs that produce a median integral efficiency of 16\%.},

	abstract = {We present a new implementation of star formation in cosmological 
simulations by considering star clusters as a unit of star formation.
Cluster particles grow in mass over several million years at the rate
determined by local gas properties, with high time resolution. The
particle growth is terminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on
the interstellar medium. We test this implementation for Milky Way-sized
galaxies at high redshift by comparing the properties of model clusters
with observations of young star clusters. We find that the cluster
initial mass function is best described by a Schechter function rather
than a single power law. In agreement with observations, at low masses
the logarithmic slope is α ≈ 1.8\{--\}2, while the cutoff at high
mass scales with the star formation rate (SFR). A related trend is a
positive correlation between the surface density of the SFR and fraction
of stars contained in massive clusters. Both trends indicate that the
formation of massive star clusters is preferred during bursts of star
formation. These bursts are often associated with major-merger events.
We also find that the median timescale for cluster formation ranges from
0.5 to 4 Myr and decreases systematically with increasing star formation
efficiency. Local variations in the gas density and cluster accretion
rate naturally lead to the scatter of the overall formation efficiency
by an order of magnitude, even when the instantaneous efficiency is kept
constant. Comparison of the formation timescale with the observed age
spread of young star clusters provides an additional important
constraint on the modeling of star formation and feedback schemes.},

	abstract = {We have undertaken the largest systematic study of the high-mass stellar initial mass function (IMF) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of 85 resolved, young (4 \{Myr\}{\textbackslash}lt t{\textbackslash}lt 25 \{Myr\}), intermediate mass star clusters (103-104
M⊙), observed as part of the Panchromatic Hubble
Andromeda Treasury program. We fit each cluster’s CMD to measure its mass function (MF) slope for stars ≳2 M⊙. By
modeling the ensemble of clusters, we find the distribution of MF slopes is best described by Γ = +\{1.45\}-0.06+0.03 with a very small intrinsic scatter and no drastic outliers. This model allows the MF slope to depend on cluster mass, size, and age, but the data imply no significant dependencies within this regime of cluster properties. The lack of an age dependence suggests that the MF slope has not significantly evolved over the first ∼25 Myr and provides direct observational evidence that the measured MF represents the IMF. Taken together, this analysis—based on an unprecedented large sample of young clusters, homogeneously constructed CMDs, well-defined selection criteria, and consistent principled modeling—implies that the
high-mass IMF slope in M31 clusters is universal. The IMF has a slope (Γ = +\{1.45\}-0.06+0.03; statistical
uncertainties) that is slightly steeper than the canonical Kroupa (+1.30) and Salpeter (+1.35) values, and our measurement of it
represents a factor of ∼20 improvement in precision over the Kroupa IMF (+1.30 ± 0.7). Using our inference model on select Milky Way (MW) and LMC high-mass IMF studies from the literature, we find \{Γ \}\{MW\}∼ +1.15+/- 0.1 and \{Γ \}\{LMC\}∼
+1.3+/- 0.1, both with intrinsic scatter of ∼0.3-0.4 dex. Thus,
while the high-mass IMF in the Local Group may be universal, systematics in the literature of IMF studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations of the high-mass IMF in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation. Consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of the high-mass IMF slope to date. To facilitate practical use over the full stellar mass spectrum, we have grafted the M31 high-mass IMF slope onto widely used sub-solar mass Kroupa and Chabrier IMFs. The increased steepness in the M31 high-mass IMF slope implies that commonly used UV- and Hα-based
star formation rates should be increased by a factor of ∼1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses {\textbackslash}gt 8 M⊙ is ∼25\%
fewer than expected for a Salpeter/Kroupa IMF.

have been obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at the
Gemini North telescope. The oxygen abundance gradient measured from the
detection of the [O III] λ4363 auroral line displays a scatter of
approximately 0.06 dex, a much smaller value than recently reported by
Rosolowsky \& Simon in this galaxy. The analysis of the abundances
for a large sample of H II regions derived from the R 23
strong-line indicator confirms that the scatter is small over the full
disk of M33, consistent with the measuring uncertainties, and comparable
to what is observed in other spiral galaxies. No evidence is therefore
found for significant azimuthal variations in the present-day
metallicity of the interstellar medium in this galaxy on spatial scales
from {\textasciitilde}100 pc to a few kpc. A considerable fraction of M33 H II regions
with auroral line detections show spectral features revealing sources of
hard ionizing radiation (such as He II emission and large [Ne III], [O
III] line fluxes). Since R 23 is shown to severely
underestimate the oxygen abundances in such cases, care must be taken in
chemical abundance studies of extragalactic H II regions based on this
strong-line indicator.

These data provide the most intensive, high spatial resolution assessment of the X-ray source populations available for the confused inner regions of M33. Mosaic images of the ChASeM33 observations show several hundred individual X-ray sources as well as soft diffuse emission from the hot interstellar medium. Bright, extended emission surrounds the nucleus and is also seen from the giant H II regions NGC 604 and IC 131. Fainter extended emission and numerous individual sources appear to trace the inner spiral structure. The initial source catalog, arising from {\textasciitilde}2/3 of the expected survey data, includes 394 sources significant at the 3 σ confidence level or greater, down to a limiting luminosity (absorbed) of {\textasciitilde}1.6 × 1035 ergs s-1 (0.35-8.0 keV). The
hardness ratios of the sources separate those with soft, thermal spectra such as supernova remnants from those with hard, nonthermal spectra such as X-ray binaries and background active galactic nuclei. Emission extended beyond the Chandra point-spread function is evident in 23 of the 394 sources. Cross-correlation of the ChASeM33 sources against previous catalogs of X-ray sources in M33 results in matches for the vast majority of the brighter sources and shows 28 ChASeM33 sources within 10'' of supernova remnants identified by prior optical and radio searches. This brings the total number of such associations to 31 out of 100 known supernova remnants in M33.},

We assume that the disc originates and grows by primordial gas infall and adopt a simple form of gas accretion rate with one free parameter, the infall time-scale. We also include the contribution of the gas outflow process. A major update of the model is that we adopt a molecular-hydrogen-correlated star-formation law and calculate the evolution of the atomic and molecular gas separately. Comparisons between the model predictions and observational data show that the model predictions are very sensitive to the adopted infall time-scale, while the gas-outflow process mainly influences the
metallicity profile. A model adopting a moderate outflow rate and an inside-out formation scenario can be in good agreement with most of the observed constraints of the M33 disc. We also compare model predictions based on a molecular-hydrogen-correlated star-formation law and that based on the Kennicutt star-formation law. Our results imply that the molecular-hydrogen-correlated star-formation law should be preferred to describe the evolution of the M33 disc, especially the radial
distributions of both the cold gas and the stellar population.},

	abstract = {The Milky Way (MW) offers a uniquely detailed view of galactic structure 
and is often regarded as a prototypical spiral galaxy. But recent
observations indicate that the MW is atypical: it has an undersized
supermassive black hole at its centre; it is surrounded by a very low
mass, excessively metal-poor stellar halo; and it has an unusually large
nearby satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Here, we show
that the LMC is on a collision course with the MW with which it will
merge in 2.4{\textasciicircum}\{+1.2\}\_\{-0.8\} \{Gyr\} (68 per cent confidence level). This
catastrophic and long-overdue event will restore the MW to normality.
Using the EAGLE galaxy formation simulation, we show that, as a result
of the merger, the central supermassive black hole will increase in mass
by up to a factor of 8. The Galactic stellar halo will undergo an
equally impressive transformation, becoming 5 times more massive. The
additional stars will come predominantly from the disrupted LMC, but a
sizeable number will be ejected on to the halo from the stellar disc.
The post-merger stellar halo will have the median metallicity of the
LMC, [Fe/H] = -0.5 dex, which is typical of other galaxies of similar
mass to the MW. At the end of this exceptional event, the MW will become
a true benchmark for spiral galaxies, at least temporarily.},

Star formation in
turbulence-compressed regions should be as hierarchical as the
turbulence, leading to clusters and multiple star systems instead of single stars; some binary stars may form by gravitational capture of stars in nearby turbulent clumps.  Reasonable mass functions for clumps and stars are estimated from the theory.  The slope of the initial stellar mass function is steeper than that for the clumps because of the increasing lifetime for clumps with larger mass.},

This process may be very effective in destroying molecular clouds; if approximately 4 per cent of a cloud's material were converted into new stars with a Salpeter Initial Mass Function, the remaining 96 per cent could be broken up and
dispersed by the ionizing radiation from the O stars.},

discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on
three central questions: What controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy
converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and
what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound
structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does
it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three questions as a
lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review
of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I
then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of
the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities
for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them.
I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in
the coming years.},

The sample spans a factor of 5 in mean metallicity. The rms scatter of individual points of the relation is only about a factor of 2 for all the galaxies, although some show much more scatter than others. Using these results, we propose a modiﬁed star formation prescription based on pressure determining the degree to which the ISM is molecular. The formulation is different in high- and low-pressure regimes, deﬁned by whether the gas is primarily atomic or primarily molecular. This formulation can be implemented in simulations and provides a more appropriate treatment of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and molecule-poor systems, such as dwarf irregulars and damped Ly  systems.},

This situation persists despite the potential for the Milky Way to serve as the ultimate SFR calibrator for external galaxies. We show that various estimates for the Galactic SFR are consistent with one another once they have been normalized to the same initial mass function (IMF) and massive star models, converging to 1.9 ± 0.4 M yr−1. However, standard SFR diagnostics are vulnerable to systematics founded in the use of indirect observational tracers sensitive only to high-mass stars. We ﬁnd that absolute SFRs measured using resolved low/intermediate-mass stellar populations in Galactic H ii regions are systematically higher by factors of ∼2–3 compared with calibrations for SFRs measured from mid-IR and radio emission. We discuss some potential explanations for this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law slope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M {\textless} m {\textless} 5M ) stars were steeper than the Salpeter slope or (2) a correction factor was applied to the extragalactic 24 μm SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star formation in individual mid-IR–bright H ii regions relative to the lifetimes of O stars. Finally, we present some approaches for testing whether a Galactic SFR of ∼2 M yr−1 is consistent with what we would measure if we could view the Milky Way as external observers. Using luminous radio supernova remnants and X-ray point sources, we ﬁnd that the Milky Way deviates from expectations at the 1σ –3σ level, hinting that perhaps the Galactic SFR is overestimated or extragalactic SFRs need to be revised upward.},

	abstract = {Images recorded with MegaCam are used to investigate the recent (t 0.25 Gyr) star-forming history (SFH) of the Local Group Sc galaxy M33. The data sample the entire star-forming disk, as well as areas immediately to the north and south of the galaxy. The properties of the stellar disk change near RGC = 8 kpc. Within this radius the luminosity function of main-sequence stars indicates that the star formation rate (SFR) has been constant with time during at least the past 250 Myr, while at larger radii the SFR has declined during this same time period. That the recent SFR in the inner disk has been constant suggests that M33 has evolved in isolation for at least the past ∼0.5 Gyr, thereby providing a constraint on the timing of any recent interaction with M31. The color of the main-sequence ridgeline changes with radius, suggesting a gradient in extinction of size ΔAV /ΔRGC = −0.05 mag kpc−1. The fractional contribution that young stars make to the total mass of the stellar disk changes with radius, peaking near 8 kpc. Evidence is also presented of systematic spatial variations in the SFH of the disk, such that the SFR during the past 100 Myr in the southern half of the galaxy has been ∼0.4 dex higher than in the northern half. Finally, structures with sizes spanning many kpc that contain blue objects—presumably main-sequence stars that formed during intermediate epochs—are identiﬁed near the disk boundary. It is argued that these are tidal features that were pulled from the main body of M33 and—in some cases—are the fossil remnants of star formation that occurred in an extended disk during intermediate epochs.},

We show the 12 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m emission to be a linear estimator of total SFR on spatial scales from 782 pc down to 49 pc, over almost four magnitudes in SFR. These results therefore extend to sub-kpc length scales the analogous results from other studies for global length scales. We use high-resolution HI and \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CO\}(J=2-1)\$ image sets from the literature to compare the star formation to the neutral gas. For the full range of length scales we find well-defined power-law relationships between 12 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m-derived SFR surface densities and neutral gas surface densities. For the H\$\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{2\}\$ gas component almost all correlations are consistent with being linear. No evidence is found for a breakdown in the star formation law at small length scales in M 33 reported by other authors. We show that the average star formation efficiency in M 33 is roughly \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and that it remains constant down to giant molecular cloud length scales. Toomre and shear-based models of the star formation threshold are shown to inaccurately account for the star formation activity in the inner disc of M 33. Finally, we clearly show that the HI saturation limit of \${\textbackslash}approx 9\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ pc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ reported in the literature for other galaxies is not an intrinsic property of M 33 - it is systematically introduced as an artefact of spatially smoothing the data.},

The SFR is calculated using the far-ultraviolet and 24 μm emission, corrected for the old stellar population in M31. We ﬁnd a global value for the SFR of 0.25+−00..0064 M yr−1 and compare this with the SFR found using the total far-infrared luminosity. There is general agreement in regions where young stars dominate the dust heating. Atomic hydrogen (H i) and molecular gas (traced by carbon monoxide, CO) or the dust mass is used to trace the total gas in the ISM. We show that the global surface densities of SFR and gas mass place M31 among a set of low-SFR galaxies in the plot of Kennicutt. The relationship between SFR and gas surface density is tested in six radial annuli across M31, assuming a power law relationship with index, N. The star formation (SF) law using total gas traced by H i and CO gives a global index of N = 2.03 ± 0.04, with a signiﬁcant variation with radius; the highest values are observed in the 10 kpc ring. We suggest that this slope is due to H i turning molecular at ΣGas ∼ 10 M pc−2. When looking at H2 regions, we measure a higher mean SFR suggesting a better spatial correlation between H2 and SF. We ﬁnd N ∼ 0.6 with consistent results throughout the disk—this is at the low end of values found in previous work and argues against a superlinear SF law on small scales.},

We have measured the global HCN line luminosity, and the observations are reported in Paper I. This paper analyzes the relationships between the total far-IR luminosity (a tracer of the star formation rate), the global HCN line luminosity (a measure of the total dense molecular gas content), and the CO luminosity (a measure of the total molecular content). We find a tight linear correlation between the IR and HCN luminosities L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HCN{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (in the log-log plot) with a correlation coefficient R=0.94, and an almost constant average ratio L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HCN{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=900L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(Kkms{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}pc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The IR-HCN linear correlation is valid over 3 orders of magnitude including ULIGs, the most luminous objects in the local universe. The direct consequence of the linear IR-HCN correlation is that the star formation law in terms of dense molecular gas content has a power-law index of 1.0. The global star formation rate is linearly proportional to the mass of dense molecular gas in normal spiral galaxies, LIGs, and ULIGs. This is strong evidence in favor of star formation as the power source in ultraluminous galaxies since the star formation in these galaxies appears to be normal and expected given their high mass of dense star-forming molecular gas. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The HCN-CO correlation is also much tighter than the IR-CO correlation. We suggest that the nonlinear correlation between L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}CO{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} may be a consequence of the stronger and perhaps more physical correlations between L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HCN{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and between L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HCN{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}CO{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Thus, the star formation rate indicated by L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} depends on the amount of dense molecular gas traced by HCN emission, not the total molecular gas traced by CO emission. One of the main arguments in favor of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) as the power source in ULIGs is the anomalously high ratio L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}CO{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} or L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M(H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) or high star formation rate per M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} of gas, compared with that from normal spiral galaxies. This has been interpreted as indicating that a dust-enshrouded AGN is required to produce the very high luminosity. Viewed in terms of the dense gas mass the situation is completely different. The ratio L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HCN{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} or L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}dense{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, a measure of the star formation rate per solar mass of dense gas, is essentially the same in all galaxies including ULIGs. The ratio L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}dense{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is virtually independent of galaxy luminosity and on average L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}IR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}dense{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}90L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, about the same as in GMC cores but much higher than in GMCs. We find that ULIGs simply have a large quantity of dense molecular gas and thus produce a prodigious starburst that heats the dust, produces the IR, and blocks all or most optical radiation. The HCN global luminosity may be used as an indicator of the star formation rate in high-redshift objects including hyperluminous galaxies. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The HCN/CO ratio is an indicator of the dense molecular gas fraction and gauges the globally averaged molecular gas density. We find that the HCN/CO ratio is a powerful starburst indicator.

Normal spirals all have similar and low dense gas fractions L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HCN{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}CO{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.02-0.05. The global star formation efficiency depends on the fraction of the molecular gas in a dense phase.},

We have gridded the survey into {\textasciitilde}9000 regions that are {\textasciitilde}100 pc x 100 pc in projected size. Treating each region independently, we model the optical color-magnitude diagrams and measure the SFHs over the past 400-600 Myr. We combine the individual SFHs to create maps of star formation (SF) across a contiguous 1/3 of M31's star forming disk, providing an unprecedented perspective on patterns of star formation in an Lstar galaxy. Our maps clearly recover M31's famous ringed structures and reveal that the 5 and 15 kpc rings formed within the last {\textasciitilde}250 Myr and are transient in nature. In contrast, the 10 kpc ring appears to be long-lived (\&gt;500 Myr), with some evidence for broadening of the ring and dispersion of stars into the stellar disk over the accessible lookback time. It also dominates the global recent SF; the majority of the total stellar mass budget within the last {\textasciitilde}500 Myr comes from the 10 kpc ring. Our global SFH of M31 is roughly constant over the last {\textasciitilde}500 Myr, with a notable peak 50 Myr ago and a shallow decline toward the present.

	abstract = {We revisit the orbital history of the Triangulum galaxy (M33) around the Andromeda galaxy (M31) in view of the recent Gaia Data Release 2 proper motion measurements for both Local Group galaxies. Earlier studies consider highly idealized dynamical friction, but neglect the effects of dynamical mass loss. We show the latter process to be important using orbit integrations and N-body simulations, which are mutually consistent. Contrary to previous claims that only a `first infall' is supported by the data, we find an orbital solution that brings these galaxies to within {\textasciitilde}50 kpc of each other in the past, i.e. {\textasciitilde}6.5 Gyr ago. We explore the implications of this finding using a N-body/hydrodynamical simulation to model the infall of M33 into M31 with a focus on the origin of two prominent features of this system: 1) M31's metal-rich Giant Stellar Stream; and 2) the M31-M33 HI filament. We find that the tidal interaction does not produce a stellar structure reminiscent of the stellar stream that survives up to the present day. The observed, outer disc warp in M33 may well be a relic of this past interaction. Similarly, the HI filament is likely a fossil structure dating back to the time of the ancient encounter between these galaxies. Our model implies the existence of a much larger, diffuse gas stream, the `Triangulum stream', that extends from M33 away from M31. We anticipate upcoming observations with the recently commissioned, Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) that will target the putative stream in its first years of operation.},

	abstract = {The 3D velocities of M31 and M33 are important for understanding the evolution and cosmological context of the Local Group. Their most massive stars are detected by Gaia, and we use Data Release 2 (DR2) to determine the galaxy proper motions (PMs). We select galaxy members based on, e.g., parallax, PM, color-magnitude diagram location, and local stellar density. The PM rotation of both galaxies is confidently detected, consistent with the known line-of-sight rotation curves: \{V\vphantom{\{}\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}=-206+/- 86 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (counterclockwise) for M31, and \{V\vphantom{\{}\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}=80 +/- 52 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (clockwise) for M33. We measure the center-of-mass PM of each galaxy relative to surrounding background quasars in DR2. This yields that (\{μ \}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α * {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater},\{μ \}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}δ {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) equals (65+/- 18,-57+/- 15) μ \{as\} \{yr\vphantom{\{}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for M31 and (31+/- 19,-29+/- 16) μ \{as\} \{yr\vphantom{\{}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for M33. In addition to the listed random errors, each component has an additional residual systematic error of 16 μ \{as\} \{yr\vphantom{\{}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. These results are consistent at 0.8σ and 1.0σ with the (2 and 3 times higher accuracy) measurements already available from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging and Very Long Baseline Array water maser observations, respectively. This lends confidence that all these measurements are robust. The new results imply that the M31 orbit toward the Milky Way (MW) is somewhat less radial than previously inferred, \{V\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}{\textbackslash}tan ,\{DR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}2+\{HST\}\}=\{57\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-31{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+35{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and strengthen arguments that M33 may be on its first infall into M31.

	abstract = {The star formation history of the northern and southern M31 disk is measured using samples of BV photometry for 40 Â 40 regions taken from the KPNO/CTIO Local Group Survey. The distances, mean reddening values, and age distributions of the stars in these regions were measured using the routines of Dolphin. Independent measurements of overlapping ﬁelds show that the results are stable for most samples. A slight distance gradient is seen across the major axis of the southern disk, and a mean distance of 24:47 Æ 0:03 is found by combining the results. Higher mean reddening values are seen to follow the spiral structure. The stellar age distributions are consistent with episodic star formation conﬁned mainly to the gas-rich arm regions. If these episodes were caused by propagating density waves, the waves did not cause signiﬁcant star formation episodes in the gas-poor interarm regions. A combination of all of the results provides the total star formation rate for 1.4 deg2 of the M31 disk for six epochs. These results suggest that star formation in the disk declined by \$50\% from \$250 to \$50 Myr ago. The lowest star formation rate occurred \$25 Myr ago, followed by a \$20\% increase to the present. The mean star formation rate for this large portion of M31 over the past 60 Myr is 0:63 Æ 0:07 M  yrÀ1, suggesting a total mean rate for the disk of \$1 M  yrÀ1.},

We perform an analysis of the star formation law on a variety of pixel scales, from 25 arcsec to 500 arcsec (100 pc to 2 kpc). At kpc scales, we find that a linear Schmidt-type power law index is suitable for molecular gas, but the index appears to be much higher with total gas, and gas from dust.

	abstract = {We present near-infrared mosaics of J, H, and K emission from the central 15 min x 30 min in M33 which map the stellar distribution of its disk and spheroidal components. Detailed examination of individual OB associations and population synthesis models show that recent massive star formation contributes significantly to near infrared emission, which must be considered in deriving the stellar mass distribution. The scale length of the exponential disk is less than 6 min, shorter than optical scale lengths in part because of a radial gradient in
extinction. We identify two grand-design spiral arms with an underlying stellar component in the inner 9 min; these terminate near the radius at which the rotation curve begins to flatten. A weak, bar-shaped excess in the stellar mass distribution is present in the inner 1.5 min; it is unclear whether this traces the inward extension of the spiral arms or a true bar. We find the spheroidal light is reasonably fitted by a single r1/4 distribution with a scale length much longer than previously reported for the central spheroidal component. Including a compact bulgelike component does not significantly improve the fit to the surface photometry indicating that the contribution of a compact bulge component to the spherodial light must be very low. In previous studies of M33, the ratio of the number of globular clusters to spheroid luminosity was anomalously high. Our more extended spheroid results in a ratio closer to that obtained for other spiral galaxies, although it is still high.},

	abstract = {We present the star cluster catalogs for 17 dwarf and irregular galaxies in the \$HST\$ Treasury Program "Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey" (LEGUS). Cluster identification and photometry in this subsample are similar to that of the entire LEGUS sample, but special methods were developed to provide robust catalogs with accurate fluxes due to low cluster statistics. The colors and ages are largely consistent for two widely used aperture corrections, but a significant fraction of the clusters are more compact than the average training cluster. However, the ensemble luminosity, mass, and age distributions are consistent suggesting that the systematics between the two methods are less than the random errors. When compared with the clusters from previous dwarf galaxy samples, we find that the LEGUS catalogs are more complete and provide more accurate total fluxes. Combining all clusters into a composite dwarf galaxy, we find that the luminosity and mass functions can be described by a power law with the canonical index of \$-2\$ independent of age and global SFR binning. The age distribution declines as a power law, with an index of \${\textbackslash}approx-0.80{\textbackslash}pm0.15\$, independent of cluster mass and global SFR binning. This decline of clusters is dominated by cluster disruption since the combined star formation histories and integrated-light SFRs are both approximately constant over the last few hundred Myr. Finally, we find little evidence for an upper-mass cutoff (\${\textless}2{\textbackslash}sigma\$) in the composite cluster mass function, and can rule out a truncation mass below \${\textbackslash}approx10{\textasciicircum}\{4.5\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ but cannot rule out the existence of a truncation at higher masses.},

This general insight appears to hold for populations including present-day star formation in small molecular clouds, rich and dense massive star-clusters forming in giant clouds, through to ancient and metal-poor exotic stellar populations that may be dominated by dark matter. This apparent universality of the IMF is a challenge for star formation theory because elementary considerations suggest that the IMF ought to systematically vary with star-forming conditions.},

The full survey will resolve the galaxy into more than 100 million stars with projected radii from 0-20 kpc over a contiguous 0.5 square degree area in 828 orbits, producing imaging in the F275W and F336W filters with WFC3/UVIS, F475W and F814W with ACS/WFC, and F110W and F160W with WFC3/IR. The resulting wavelength coverage gives excellent constraints on stellar temperature, bolometric luminosity, and extinction for most spectral types. The photometry reaches SNR=4 at F275W=25.1, F336W=24.9, F475W=27.9, F814W=27.1, F110W=25.5, and F160W=24.6 for single pointings in the uncrowded outer disk; however, the optical and NIR data are crowding limited, and the deepest reliable magnitudes are up to 5 magnitudes brighter in the inner bulge. All pointings are dithered and produce Nyquist-sampled images in F475W, F814W, and F160W. We describe the observing strategy, photometry, astrometry, and data products, along with extensive tests of photometric stability, crowding errors, spatially-dependent photometric biases, and telescope pointing control. We report on initial fits to the structure of M31's disk, derived from the density of RGB stars, in a way that is independent of the assumed M/L and is robust to variations in dust extinction. These fits also show that the 10 kpc ring is not just a region of enhanced recent star formation, but is instead a dynamical structure containing a significant overdensity of stars with ages {\textgreater}1 Gyr.

the literature nothing is known except the raw position and an
approximate size. Aims: The main goal of this study is to
determine a full set of uniform spatial, structural, kinematic, and
astrophysical parameters for as many known open clusters as possible.
 Methods: On the basis of stellar data from PPMXL and 2MASS, we
used a dedicated data-processing pipeline to determine kinematic and
photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. Results: For an input list of 3784 targets from the literature, we
confirm that 3006 are real objects, the vast majority of them are open
clusters, but associations and globular clusters are also present. For
each confirmed object we determined the exact position of the cluster
centre, the apparent size, proper motion, distance, colour excess, and
age. For about 1500 clusters, these basic astrophysical parameters have
been determined for the first time. For the bulk of the clusters we also
derived the tidal radius. We estimated additionally average radial
velocities for more than 30\% of the confirmed clusters. The present
sample (called MWSC) reaches both the central parts of the Milky Way and
its outer regions. It is almost complete up to 1.8 kpc from the Sun and
also covers neighbouring spiral arms. However, for a small subset of the
oldest open clusters (log t ≳ 9) we found some evidence of
incompleteness within about 1 kpc from the Sun.

	abstract = {Globular cluster ages provide both an important test of models of 
globular cluster formation and a powerful method to constrain the
assembly history of galaxies. Unfortunately, measuring the ages of
unresolved old stellar populations has proven challenging. Here, we
present a novel technique that combines optical photometry with
metallicity constraints from near-infrared spectroscopy in order to
measure ages. After testing the method on globular clusters in the Milky
Way and its satellite galaxies, we apply our technique to three massive
early-type galaxies using data from the SAGES Legacy Unifying Globulars
and GalaxieS (SLUGGS) survey. The three SLUGGS galaxies and the Milky
Way show dramatically different globular cluster age and metallicity
distributions, with NGC 1407 and the Milky Way showing mostly old
globular clusters, while NGC 3115 and NGC 3377 show a range of globular
ages. This diversity implies different galaxy formation histories and
that the globular cluster optical colour-metallicity relation is not
universal as is commonly assumed in globular cluster studies. We find a
correlation between the median age of the metal-rich globular cluster
populations and the age of the field star populations, in line with
models where globular cluster formation is a natural outcome of
high-intensity star formation.},

spectrograph at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The spectra cover the range {\textasciitilde}3350-6430 Å with {\textasciitilde}3.1 Å (FWHM) resolution.
The spectroscopic observations and data reduction were designed to integrate the full projected area within the cluster core radii in order to properly sample the light from stars in all relevant evolutionary stages. The S/N values of the flux-calibrated spectra range from 50 to 240 Å-1 at 4000 Å and from 125 to 500
Å-1 at 5000 Å. The selected targets span a wide
range of cluster parameters, including metallicity, horizontal-branch morphology, Galactic coordinates, Galactocentric distance, and
concentration. The total sample is thus fairly representative of the entire Galactic globular cluster population and should be valuable for comparison with similar integrated spectra of unresolved stellar populations in remote systems. For most of the library clusters, our spectra can be coupled with deep color-magnitude diagrams and reliable metal abundances from the literature to enable the calibration of stellar population synthesis models. In this paper we present a detailed account of the observations and data reduction. The spectral library is publicly available in electronic format from the National Optical Astronomical Observatory Web site.},

pseudo-random cadences enabling sensitivity to periods from days to months. We supplement these data with archival V- and I-band HST data obtained in 1995 and 2005, providing sensitivity to variability on decade timescales. At least 50\% of stars brighter than M
I,814 = -7 show strong evidence for variability within our Cycle 24 data; among stars with
\{V\}606-\{I\}814{\textgreater} 2 the variability fraction rises to ≈100\%. Large amplitude variability ({\textgreater}0.3 mag) on decade
timescales is restricted to red supergiants (RSGs) and very luminous blue stars. Both populations display fairly smooth variability on month-year timescales. The Cepheid instability strip is clearly visible in our data, although the variability fraction within this region never exceeds ≈10\%. The location of variable stars across the CMD broadly agrees with theoretical sources of variability, including the
instability strip, RSG pulsational instabilities, long-period
fundamental mode pulsations, and radiation-dominated envelopes in massive stars. Our data can be used to place stringent constraints on the precise onset of these various instabilities and their lifetimes and growth rates.},

	abstract = {The chemical homogeneity of surviving stellar clusters contains important clues about interstellar medium (ISM) mixing efficiency, star formation, and the enrichment history of the Galaxy. Existing
measurements in a handful of open clusters suggest homogeneity in several elements at the 0.03 dex level. Here we present (i) a new cluster member catalog based only on APOGEE radial velocities and Gaia-DR2 proper motions, (ii) improved abundance uncertainties for APOGEE cluster members, and (iii) the dependence of cluster homogeneity on Galactic and cluster properties, using abundances of eight elements from the APOGEE survey for 10 high-quality clusters. We find that cluster homogeneity is uncorrelated with Galactocentric distance,   \${\textbar} Z{\textbar} \$ , age, and metallicity. However, velocity dispersion, which is a proxy for cluster mass, is positively correlated with intrinsic scatter at relatively high levels of significance for [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe]. We also see a possible positive correlation at a low level of significance for [Ni/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Fe/H], while [Cr/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] are uncorrelated. The elements that show a correlation with velocity dispersion are those that are predominantly produced by core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). However, the small sample size and relatively low correlation significance highlight the need for follow-up studies. If borne out by future studies, these findings would suggest a quantitative difference between the correlation lengths of elements produced
predominantly by Type Ia SNe versus CCSNe, which would have implications for Galactic chemical evolution models and the feasibility of chemical tagging.},

(SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 μm photometry,
optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies
with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a
limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1
σ{\textless}{\textasciitilde}+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to
logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{\textgreater}1,
while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of
the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of
SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend
{\textasciitilde}67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {\textless}{\textasciitilde}2(4) of
their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of
the evolution of SF since z{\textasciitilde}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the
average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of
starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in
starbursts. LIRGs at z{\textasciitilde}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for
massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same
set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching
processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant
role.},

(ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Hα). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Hα measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Hα, and where Hα is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of
the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Hα emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to
quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Hα show signs of star formation in the UV. We
derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

(SFRs) inferred from the far ultraviolet (FUV) non-ionizing continuum
and Hα nebular emission, assuming standard conversion recipes in
which the SFR scales linearly with luminosity at a given wavelength. Our
analysis probes SFRs over 5 orders of magnitude, down to ultra-low
activities on the order of {\textasciitilde}10-4 M sun
yr-1. The data are drawn from the 11 Mpc Hα and
Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey (11HUGS), which has obtained Hα fluxes
from ground-based narrowband imaging, and UV fluxes from imaging with
GALEX. For normal spiral galaxies (SFR {\textasciitilde} 1 M sun
yr-1), our results are consistent with previous work which
has shown that FUV SFRs tend to be lower than Hα SFRs before
accounting for internal dust attenuation, but that there is relative
consistency between the two tracers after proper corrections are
applied. However, a puzzle is encountered at the faint end of the
luminosity function. As lower luminosity dwarf galaxies, roughly less
active than the Small Magellanic Cloud, are examined, Hα tends to
increasingly underpredict the total SFR relative to the FUV. The trend
is evident prior to corrections for dust attenuation, which affects the
FUV more than the nebular Hα emission, so this general conclusion
is robust to the effects of dust. Although past studies have suggested
similar trends, this is the first time this effect is probed with a
statistical sample for galaxies with SFR {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 M sun
yr-1. By SFR {\textasciitilde} 0.003 M sun yr-1, the
average Hα-to-FUV flux ratio is lower than expected by a factor of
two, and at the lowest SFRs probed, the ratio exhibits an order of
magnitude discrepancy for the handful of galaxies that remain in the
sample. A range of standard explanations does not appear to be able to
fully account for the magnitude of the systematic. Some recent work has
argued for a stellar initial mass function which is deficient in
high-mass stars in dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and we
also consider this scenario. Under the assumption that the FUV traces
the SFR in dwarf galaxies more robustly, the prescription relating
Hα luminosity to SFR is re-calibrated for use in the low SFR
regime when FUV data are not available.},

[OIII]4959, 5007 emission lines. We present the results of the first targeted observations of the object in the optical, ultraviolet and X-ray, which show that the object contains highly ionized gas. Although the line ratios are similar to extended emission-line regions near luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), the source of this ionization is not apparent. The emission-line properties, and lack of X-ray emission from IC2497, suggest either a highly obscured AGN with a novel geometry arranged to allow photoionization of the object but not the galaxy's own circumnuclear gas, or, as we argue, the first detection of a quasar light echo. In this case, either the luminosity of the central source has decreased dramatically or else the obscuration in the system has increased within 105yr. This object may thus represent the first direct probe of quasar history on these time-scales.

have examined the luminosity functions and number ratios between AGB and
red giant branch (RGB) stars from a sample of resolved galaxies from the
ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury. This database provides Hubble Space
Telescope optical photometry together with maps of completeness,
photometric errors, and star formation histories for dozens of galaxies
within 4 Mpc. We select 12 galaxies characterized by predominantly
metal-poor populations as indicated by a very steep and blue RGB, and
which do not present any indication of recent star formation in their
color-magnitude diagrams. Thousands of AGB stars brighter than the tip
of the RGB (TRGB) are present in the sample (between 60 and 400 per
galaxy), hence, the Poisson noise has little impact in our measurements
of the AGB/RGB ratio. We model the photometric data with a few sets of
thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) evolutionary models with different
prescriptions for the mass loss. This technique allows us to set
stringent constraints on the TP-AGB models of low-mass, metal-poor stars
(with M {\textless} 1.5 M sun, [Fe/H]≲ -1.0). Indeed, those
which satisfactorily reproduce the observed AGB/RGB ratios have TP-AGB
lifetimes between 1.2 and 1.8 Myr, and finish their nuclear burning
lives with masses between 0.51 and 0.55 M sun. This is also
in good agreement with recent observations of white dwarf masses in the
M4 old globular cluster. These constraints can be added to those already
derived from Magellanic Cloud star clusters as important mileposts in
the arduous process of calibrating AGB evolutionary models.},

2 must not be used), measuring full uncertainties in all
reported parameters, quantifying the goodness-of-fit, and questions of
binning the CMD and incorporating outside information. Several example
star formation history measurements are given. Two examples involve
synthetic data, in which the input and recovered parameters can be
compared to locate possible flaws in the methodology (none were
apparent) and measure the accuracy with which ages, metallicities and
star formation rates can be recovered. Solutions of the histories of
seven Galactic dwarf spheroidal companions (Carina, Draco, Leo I, Leo

measure star formation histories given a variety of conditions - numbers
of stars, complexity of star formation history and amount of foreground
contamination. Significant measurements of ancient {\textgreater}8Gyr star
formation are made in all seven galaxies. Sculptor, Draco and Ursa Minor

to be the relics of a gravothermal core collapse that occurred sometime
in the clusters' past. Recent observations show that the centers of such
clusters are bluer than their outskirts, indicating that the stellar
populations there are somehow different than those farther out,
presumably as a result of unusual physical processes that took place in
these extremely dense regions. Here I analyze a large body of digital
imagery from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Hubble Space
Telescope to obtain color-magnitude and color-color diagrams for stars
in the central two arcminutes of the prototypical core-cusp globular
cluster M15 = NGC 7078 = C 2127 + 119. These data were reduced with a
new computer program, named ALLFRAME, that is described in detail here
for the first time. ALLFRAME makes simultaneous use of the geometric and
photometric information from all images of a given field to derive a
self-consistent set of positions and magnitudes for all detected
starlike objects in that area of sky, thereby extending the range of
magnitude and crowding conditions for which useful photometry is
obtainable. I tentatively conclude that the color gradient in M15 is due
to three distinct effects: (1) there is a deficiency of the brightest
red giants in the central regions of the cluster; (2) the giant branch
of the dominant cluster population shifts systematically toward the blue
as the center of the cluster is approached; and (3) the very center of
the cluster (radius approximately equal or less than 12 seconds)
contains a large population of blue and yellow stragglers that occupy
the area of the color-magnitude diagram between the main-sequence
turnoff and the horizontal branch and between the extended blue
horizontal branch and the subgiant branch; many of these appear to have
a significant ultraviolet excess.},

triplet lines. Our calibration thus extends from -4.0 to +0.5 in

fundamentalized periods for the 32 clusters having more than 12
pulsators with well recognized period and pulsation mode. One finds that the range of fundamentalized periods covered by the variables in a given cluster remains fairly constant in varying the cluster metallicity all over the metallicity range spanned by the cluster sample, with the only two exceptions given by M 15 and NGC 6441. We conclude that the width in temperature of the RR Lyrae instability strip appears largely
independent of the cluster metallicity. At the same time, it appears that the fundamentalized periods are not affected by the predicted variation of pulsators luminosity with metal abundance, indicating the occurrence of a correlated variation in the pulsator mass. We discuss mean periods in a selected sample of statistically significant ``RR rich" clusters with no less than 10 RRab and 5 RRc variables. One finds a clear evidence for the well known Oosterhoff dichotomy in the mean period of ab-type variables, together with a similarly
clear evidence for a constancy of the mean fundamentalized period in passing from Oosterhoff type II to type I clusters. On
this basis, the origin of the Oosterhoff dichotomy is discussed, presenting evidence against a strong dependence of the RR Lyrae
luminosity on the metal content. On the contrary, i) the continuity of the mean fundamentalized period, ii) the period frequency histograms in the two prototypes M 3 (type I) and M 15 (type II), iii) the relative abundance of first overtone pulsators, and iv) the observed difference between mean fundamental and fundamentalized periods
, all agree in suggesting the dominant occurrence of a
variation in the pulsation mode in a middle region of the instability strip (the ``OR" zone), where variables of Oosterhoff type I and type II clusters are pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode, respectively.},

Using 2.7 million photometric measurements collected over 10 yr, we confirm the results of Kelly et al. and Kozłowski et al. that this model can explain quasar light curves at an impressive fidelity level (0.01-0.02 mag). The DRW model provides a simple, fast (O(N) for N data points), and powerful statistical description of quasar light curves by a characteristic timescale (τ) and an asymptotic rms variability on long timescales (SF∞). We searched for correlations
between these two variability parameters and physical parameters such as luminosity and black hole mass, and rest-frame wavelength. Our analysis shows SF∞ to increase with decreasing luminosity and
rest-frame wavelength as observed previously, and without a correlation with redshift. We find a correlation between SF∞ and
black hole mass with a power-law index of 0.18 ± 0.03,
independent of the anti-correlation with luminosity. We find that τ increases with increasing wavelength with a power-law index of 0.17, remains nearly constant with redshift and luminosity, and increases with increasing black hole mass with a power-law index of 0.21 ± 0.07. The amplitude of variability is anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio, which suggests a scenario where optical fluctuations are tied to variations in the accretion rate. However, we find an additional dependence on luminosity and/or black hole mass that cannot be explained by the trend with Eddington ratio. The radio-loudest quasars have systematically larger variability amplitudes by about 30\%, when
corrected for the other observed trends, while the distribution of their characteristic timescale is indistinguishable from that of the full sample. We do not detect any statistically robust differences in the characteristic timescale and variability amplitude between the full sample and the small subsample of quasars detected by ROSAT.

Methods: The data sample consists of more than 75 000 high-precision CCD time series measurements in the V band obtained mainly at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, with additional data from S. Pedro Mártir and Loiano
observatories, over a time span of ten nights. The field covers an area of 42 × 28 arcmin{\textasciicircum}2. Results: We have discovered 260 new
variables and re-determined periods and amplitudes of 70 known variable stars. By means of a photometric evaluation of the membership in NGC 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the proper motions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster and
surrounding field in the range 16⪉ V{\textless} 23.5. Accurate periods can be given for the variables with P⪉ 4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limited time-baseline hampered precise determinations. We categorized the entire sample as follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variables and 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables for which we cannot give a
variability class since their periods are much longer than our time baseline. Conclusions: On the basis of photometric
considerations, and of the positions of the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 new variable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membership is doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. We also detected an outburst of about 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to the cluster and we suggest that this star could be a new U Gem (dwarf nova) cataclysmic variable.

	abstract = {Context. Open clusters are convenient probes of the structure and history of the Galactic disk. They are also fundamental to stellar evolution studies. The second Gaia data release contains precise astrometry at the submilliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky. Aims: In this study we aim to establish a list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone. Methods: We compiled a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then applied an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the Gaia DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. Results: We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of Gaia DR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study.

	abstract = {We present a variability analysis of the early-release first quarter of data publicly released by the Kepler project. Using the stellar
parameters from the Kepler Input Catalog, we have separated the sample into 129,000 dwarfs and 17,000 giants and further sub-divided the luminosity classes into temperature bins corresponding approximately to the spectral classes A, F, G, K, and M. Utilizing the inherent sampling and time baseline of the public data set (30 minute sampling and 33.5 day baseline), we have explored the variability of the stellar sample. The overall variability rate of the dwarfs is 25\% for the entire sample, but can reach 100\% for the brightest groups of stars in the sample. G dwarfs are found to be the most stable with a dispersion floor of σ {\textasciitilde} 0.04 mmag. At the precision of Kepler, {\textgreater}95\% of the giant
stars are variable with a noise floor of {\textasciitilde}0.1 mmag, 0.3 mmag, and 10 mmag for the G giants, K giants, and M giants, respectively. The photometric dispersion of the giants is consistent with acoustic variations of the photosphere; the photometrically derived predicted radial velocity distribution for the K giants is in agreement with the measured radial velocity distribution. We have also briefly explored the variability fraction as a function of data set baseline (1-33 days), at the native 30 minute sampling of the public Kepler data. To within the limitations of the data, we find that the overall variability fractions increase as the data set baseline is increased from 1 day to 33 days, in particular for the most variable stars. The lower mass M dwarf, K dwarf, and G dwarf stars increase their variability more significantly than the higher mass F dwarf and A dwarf stars as the time baseline is increased, indicating that the variability of the lower mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of weeks while the variability of the higher mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of days. A study of the distribution of the variability as a function of galactic latitude suggests that sources closer to the galactic plane are more variable. This may be the result of sampling differing populations (i.e., ages) as a function of latitude or may be the result of higher background contamination that is inflating the variability fractions at lower latitudes. A comparison of the M dwarf statistics to the variability of 29 known bright M dwarfs indicates that the M dwarfs are primarily variable on timescales of weeks or longer presumably dominated by spots and binarity. On shorter timescales of hours, which are relevant for planetary transit detection, the stars are significantly less variable, with {\textasciitilde}80\% having 12 hr dispersions of 0.5 mmag or less.},

entire sample of over 150,000 target stars for periodic behavior in
their light curves and relate this to stellar characteristics. This data
set constitutes an unprecedented study of stellar variability given its
great precision and complete time coverage (with a half hour cadence).
Because the full Kepler pipeline is not currently suitable for a study
of stellar variability of this sort, we describe our procedures for
treating the "raw" pipeline data. About half of the total sample
exhibits convincing periodic variability up to two weeks, with
amplitudes ranging from differential intensity changes of less than
10-4 up to more than 10\%. K and M dwarfs have a greater
fraction of period behavior than G dwarfs. The giants in the sample have
distinctive quasi-periodic behavior, but are not periodic in the way we
define it. Not all periodicities are due to rotation, and the most
significant period is not necessarily the rotation period. We discuss
properties of the light curves, and in particular look at a sample of
very clearly periodic G dwarfs. It is clear that a large number of them
do vary because of rotation and starspots, but it will take further
analysis to fully exploit this.},

includes a detailed treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant
branch (TP-AGB) phase, covering a wide range of initial metallicities
(0.0001 {\textless} ZI {\textless} 0.06). Compared to previous releases,
the main novelties and improvements are use of new TP-AGB tracks and
related atmosphere models and spectra for M and C-type stars; inclusion
of the surface H+He+CNO abundances in the isochrone tables, accounting
for the effects of diffusion, dredge-up episodes and hot-bottom burning;
inclusion of complete thermal pulse cycles, with a complete description
of the in-cycle changes in the stellar parameters; new pulsation models
to describe the long-period variability in the fundamental and
first-overtone modes; and new dust models that follow the growth of the
grains during the AGB evolution, in combination with radiative transfer
calculations for the reprocessing of the photospheric emission. Overall,
these improvements are expected to lead to a more consistent and
detailed description of properties of TP-AGB stars expected in resolved
stellar populations, especially in regard to their mean photometric
properties from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths. We illustrate the
expected numbers of TP-AGB stars of different types in stellar
populations covering a wide range of ages and initial metallicities,
providing further details on the “C-star island” that
appears at intermediate values of age and metallicity, and about the
AGB-boosting effect that occurs at ages close to 1.6-Gyr for populations
of all metallicities. The isochrones are available through a new

	abstract = {Context. The large astrometric and photometric survey performed by the Gaia mission allows for a panoptic view of the Galactic disc and its stellar cluster population. Hundreds of stellar clusters were only discovered after the latest Gaia data release (DR2) and have yet to be characterised. Aims: Here we make use of the deep and homogeneous Gaia photometry down to G = 18 to estimate the distance, age, and interstellar reddening for about 2000 stellar clusters identified with Gaia DR2 astrometry. We use these objects to study the structure and evolution of the Galactic disc. Methods: We relied on a set of objects with well-determined parameters in the literature to train an artificial neural network to estimate parameters from the Gaia
photometry of cluster members and their mean parallax. Results: We obtain reliable parameters for 1867 clusters. Our catalogue confirms the relative lack of old stellar clusters in the inner disc (with a few notable exceptions). We also quantify and discuss the variation of scale height with cluster age, and we detect the Galactic warp in the
distribution of old clusters. Conclusions: This work results in a large and homogeneous cluster catalogue, allowing one to trace the structure of the disc out to distances of ∼4 kpc. However, the
present sample is still unable to trace the outer spiral arm of the Milky Way, which indicates that the outer disc cluster census might still be incomplete.

	abstract = {Based on a search of the literature up to 2001 May, the number of known variable stars in Galactic globular clusters is approximately 3000. Of these, more than 2200 have known periods and the majority (approximately 1800) are of the RR Lyrae type. In addition to the RR Lyrae population, there are approximately 100 eclipsing binaries, 120 SX Phoenicis variables, 60 Cepheids (including Population II Cepheids, anomalous Cepheids and RV Tauri), and 120 SR/red variables. The mean period of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables is 0.585 days, for the overtone variables it is 0.342 days (0.349 days for the first-overtone pulsators and 0.296 days for the second-overtone pulsators) and approximately 30\% are overtone pulsators. These numbers indicate that about 65\% of RR Lyrae variables in Galactic globular clusters belong to Oosterhoff type I systems. The mean period of the RR Lyrae variables in the Oosterhoff type I clusters seems to be correlated with metal abundance in the sense that the periods are longer in the more metal poor clusters. Such a correlation does not exist for the Oosterhoff type II clusters. Most of the Cepheids are in clusters with blue horizontal branches.},

	abstract = {We describe sensitive techniques for identifying variable stars in multiepoch photometry lists made in two or more bandpasses or pairwise in a single bandpass. Our search strategy employs the correlation in brightness change between paired frames, which allows the extraction of information on variability in the presence of random photometric noise. A statistic for assessing the type of variable or degree of contamination by an unresolved source (depending on circumstance) is also described, as well as a bootstrap scheme for predicting confidence intervals for detection of real variability. These detection schemes are manifestly more robust than existing search techniques. To illustrate the power of this technique, we give a two-epoch example for photometry in the field of NGC 3201, a globular cluster rich in RR Lyr variables. Even this simple application has allowed us to rediscover 34 of 57 previously known (actual) variables, to verify the misidentification of several of them, and to discover four probable new variables (three of which may be RR Lyr stars). We then apply the variability statistics to 27 V and 29 B frames centered on the young, rich, Cepheid-bearing LMC cluster NGC 1866, which have been reduced with ALLFRAME. This application has resulted in the discovery of 12 new variables, as well as the recovery of all 15 of the previously known variables that lie within this field. Specific results are: (1) the discovery of four new Cepheid variables in NGC 1866, bringing the total number of probable member Cepheids to 23, (2) periods for all but one of the 23 NGC 1866 Cepheids, (3) good evidence for photometric contamination of several variables by unresolved companions, (4) the discovery of a RRab variable in the NGC 1866 field with a peak-to-peak V light-curve amplitude of 1.0 mag, an intensity-weighted mean V mag = 19.28±0.01 mag, and a period of 0.5565 days, (5) (re)discovery of three longer-period red variables, and (6) the detection of several main-sequence or main-sequence-tumoff variable stars.},

	abstract = {It has recently been established that the properties of young star clusters (YSCs) can vary as a function of the galactic environment in which they are found. We use the cluster catalogue produced by the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) collaboration to investigate cluster properties in the spiral galaxy M51. We analyse the cluster population as a function of galactocentric distance and in arm and inter-arm regions. The cluster mass function exhibits a similar shape at all radial bins, described by a power law with a slope close to -2 and an exponential truncation around 105 M⊙. While the mass functions of the YSCs in the spiral arm and inter-arm regions have similar truncation masses, the inter-arm region mass function has a significantly steeper slope than the one in the arm region, a trend that is also observed in the giant molecular cloud mass function and predicted by simulations. The age distribution of clusters is dependent on the region considered, and is consistent with rapid disruption only in dense regions, while little disruption is observed at large galactocentric distances and in the inter-arm region. The fraction of stars forming in clusters does not show radial variations, despite the drop in the H2 surface density measured as a function of galactocentric distance. We suggest that the higher disruption rate observed in the inner part of the galaxy is likely at the origin of the observed flat cluster formation efficiency radial profile.},

We found 81 new variable stars, among them is an eclipsing binary with a variable component and possibly eccentric orbits TYC4038-693-1 which we also observed spectroscopically, four δ Scuti candidates, six other variable stars with periods falling into the interval of 35 minutes to 20 days. Furthermore, we identified 70 slowly varying stars with so far undefined periodicity.

	abstract = {We present an update to the EVEREST K2 pipeline that addresses various limitations in the previous version and improves the photometric precision of the light curves. We develop a fast regularization scheme for pixel-level decorrelation (PLD) and adapt the algorithm to include the PLD vectors of other stars to enhance the predictive power of the model and minimize overfitting, particularly for faint stars. We also modify PLD to work for saturated stars and improve its performance on variable stars, although some high-frequency variables may still suffer from overfitting. On average, EVEREST 2.0 light curves have 10-20\% higher photometric precision than those in version 1, yielding the highest-precision light curves at all \{Kp\} magnitudes of any publicly available K2 catalog. For most K2 campaigns, we recover the original Kepler precision to at least \{Kp\} = 14, and to at least \{Kp\} = 15 for campaigns 1, 5, 6, and 13. We also detrend most short-cadence targets observed by K2, obtaining even higher photometric precision for these stars. Like all aggressive, flexible models, EVEREST is prone to overfitting, and may cause a decrease in transit depths by ∼10\% we urge users to mask signals of interest using our open-source software, which we show removes this bias. Light curves for campaigns 0-8 and 10-13 are available online in the EVEREST catalog, which will be updated with future campaigns. EVEREST 2.0 is open source and is coded in a framework that can be adapted to other photometric surveys, including Kepler and the upcoming TESS mission.},

	abstract = {We determine rotation periods for 127 stars in the ∼115-Myr-old Blanco 1 open cluster using ∼200 d of photometric monitoring with the Next Generation Transit Survey. These stars span F5-M3 spectral types (1.2 M☉ ≳ M ≳ 0.3 M☉) and increase the number of known rotation periods in Blanco 1 by a factor of four. We determine rotation periods using three methods: Gaussian process (GP) regression, generalized autocorrelation function (G-ACF), and Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, and find that the GP and G-ACF methods are more applicable to evolving spot modulation patterns. Between mid-F and mid-K spectral types, single stars follow a well-defined rotation sequence from ∼2 to 10 d, whereas stars in photometric multiple systems typically rotate faster. This may suggest that the presence of a moderate-to-high mass ratio companion inhibits angular momentum loss mechanisms during the early pre-main sequence, and this signature has not been erased at ∼100 Myr. The majority of mid-F to mid-K stars display evolving modulation patterns, whereas most M stars show stable modulation signals. This morphological change coincides with the shift from a well-defined rotation sequence (mid-F to mid-K stars) to a broad rotation period distribution (late-K and M stars). Finally, we compare our rotation results for Blanco 1 to the similarly aged Pleiades: the single-star populations in both clusters possess consistent rotation period distributions, which suggests that the angular momentum evolution of stars follows a well-defined pathway that is, at least for mid-F to mid-K stars, strongly imprinted by ∼100 Myr.},

We measure rotation periods in the range 0.5-190 d, with the distribution peaking at ∼30 d. We revise the stellar masses and radii for our sample of rotators by exploiting the Gaia DR2 data. For ∼20 per cent of the sample, we compare the photometric rotation periods with those derived from different spectroscopic indicators, finding good correspondence in most cases. We compare our rotation periods distribution to the one obtained by the Kepler survey in the same mass range, and to that derived by the MEarth survey for stars in the mass range 0.07-0.25 M\_☉. The APACHE and Kepler periods distributions are in good agreement, confirming the reliability of our results, while the APACHE distribution is consistent with the MEarth result only for the older/slow rotators, and in the overlapping mass range of the two surveys. Combining the APACHE/Kepler distribution with the MEarth distribution, we highlight that the rotation period increases with decreasing stellar mass, in agreement with previous work. Our findings also suggest that the spin-down time scale, from fast to slow rotators, changes crossing the fully convective limit at \{≈\}0.3 M\_☉ for M dwarfs. The catalogue of 107 rotating M dwarfs presented here is particularly timely, as the stars are prime targets for the potential identification of transiting small planets with TESS and amenable to high-precision mass determination and further atmospheric characterization measurements.},

	abstract = {The expert system for time series analysis of irregularly spaced signals is reviewed. It consists of a number of complementary algorithms and programs, which may be effective for different types of variability. Obviously, for a pure sine signal, all the methods should produce the same results. However, for irregularly spaced signals with a complicated structure, e.g. a sum of different components, different methods may produce significantly different results. The basic approach is based on the classical method of least squares (1994OAP.....7...49A). However, contrary to common "step-by-step" methods of removal of important components (e.g. mean, trend ("detrending"), sine wave ("prewhitening"), where covariations between different components are ignored, i.e. erroneously assumed to be zero, we use complete mathematical models. Some of the methods are illustrated in the observations of the semi-regular pulsating variable RY UMa. The star shows a drastic cyclic change of semi-amplitude of pulsations between 0.01 to 0.37 mag, which is interpreted as a bias between the waves with close periods and a beat period of 4000 d (11 yr). The dominating period has changed from 307.35(8) d before 1993 to 285.26(6) d after 1993. The initial epoch of the maximum brightness for the recent interval is 2454008.8(5). It is suggested that the apparent period switch is due to variability of amplitudes of these two waves and an occasional swap of the dominating wave.

Because much computational time is needed to obtain such a matrix, its components are to be computed once for concrete N and basic functions, and then stored as a file. An algorithm is proposed for determining the contribution of the correlated signal to the 'signal noise'. The expressions are written for general form of the ACF, and illustrated by the application to autoregressive models. The statistical properties of the model parameters are studied. The method is applied to cataclysmic binaries AM Her and TT Ari.

The predictions are based on Monte Carlo simulations of the nearby population of stars, occurrence rates of planets derived from Kepler, and models for the photometric performance and sky coverage of the TESS cameras. We expect that TESS will find approximately 1700 transiting planets from 2× \{10\}5 pre-selected target stars. This includes 556 planets smaller than twice the size of Earth, of which 419 are hosted by M dwarf stars and 137 are hosted by FGK dwarfs.

Approximately 48 of the planets with R{\textless} 2 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus lie within or near the habitable zone (0.2{\textless} S/\{S\}{\textbackslash}oplus {\textless} 2); between 2 and 7 such planets have host stars brighter than \{K\}s=9. We also expect approximately 1100 detections of planets with radii 2-4 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus , and 67 planets larger than 4 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus . Additional planets larger than 2 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus can be detected around stars that are not among the pre-selected target stars, because TESS will also deliver full-frame images at a 30-minute cadence. The planet detections are accompanied by over 1000 astrophysical false positives. We discuss how TESS data and ground-based observations can be used to distinguish the false positives from genuine planets. We also discuss the prospects for follow-up observations to measure the masses and atmospheres of the TESS planets.},

This result implies the existence of systematic errors in the values of IMFs calculated in this way. We propose as an alternative using variable-size bins and dividing the stars evenly among them. Such variable-size bins yield very small biases that are only weakly dependent on the number of stars per bin. Furthermore, we show that they allow for the calculation of reliable IMFs with only a small total number of stars. Therefore, they are a preferred alternative to the standard uniform-size binning.},

It is found that once the clouds disperse due to stellar feedback, both self-gravitating star clusters and unbound stars generally remain, which arise from the same underlying continuum of substructured stellar density, ie. the hierarchical cluster formation scenario. The fraction of stars that are born within gravitationally-bound star clusters is related to the overall cloud star formation efficiency set by stellar feedback, but has significant scatter due to stochastic variations in the small-scale details of the star-forming gas flow. We use our numerical results to calibrate a model for mapping the bulk properties (mass, size, and metallicity) of self-gravitating GMCs onto the star cluster populations they form, expressed statistically in terms of cloud-level distributions. Synthesizing cluster catalogues from an observed GMC catalogue in M83, we find that this model predicts initial star cluster masses and sizes that are in good agreement with observations, using only standard IMF and stellar evolution models as inputs for feedback. Within our model, the ratio of the strength of gravity to stellar feedback is the key parameter setting the masses of star clusters, and of the various feedback channels direct stellar radiation (photon momentum and photoionization) is the most important on GMC scales.},

We discuss the design of the PHANGS-HST survey, and provide an overview of the HST data processing pipeline and first results, highlighting new methods for selecting star cluster candidates, morphological classification of candidates with convolutional neural networks, and identification of stellar associations over a range of physical scales with a watershed algorithm. We describe the cross-observatory imaging, catalogs, and software products being released at MAST, which will seed a broad range of community science, in particular, upcoming JWST study of dust embedded star formation and ISM physics.},

Three transit events from two planets were detected by citizen scientists in the month-long TESS light curve (sector 25), as part of the Planet Hunters TESS project. Modelling of the transits yields an orbital period of \$11.6264 \_\{ - 0.0025 \} {\textasciicircum} \{ + 0.0022 \}\$ d and radius of \$3.41 \_\{ - 0.12 \} {\textasciicircum} \{ + 0.14 \}\$ R⊕ for the inner planet, and a period in the range 19.26-35 d and a radius of \$5.83 \_\{ - 0.14 \} {\textasciicircum} \{ + 0.14 \}\$ R⊕ for the outer planet, which was only seen to transit once. Each signal was independently statistically validated, taking into consideration the TESS light curve as well as the ground-based spectroscopic follow-up observations. Radial velocities from HARPS-N and EXPRES yield a tentative detection of planet b, whose mass we estimate to be \$11.56 \_\{ - 6.14 \} {\textasciicircum} \{ + 6.58 \}\$ M⊕, and allow us to place an upper limit of 27.5 M⊕ (99 per cent confidence) on the mass of planet c. Due to the brightness of the host star and the strong likelihood of an extended H/He atmosphere on both planets, this system offers excellent prospects for atmospheric characterization and comparative planetology.},

Our sample consists of 25 pulsators: ten fundamental mode, three overtone and two double-mode classical Cepheids, plus three type II and seven anomalous Cepheids. The targets were chosen from fields with different stellar densities, both from the Galactic field and from the Magellanic System. Three targets have 2 minutes cadence light curves available by the TESS Science Processing Operations Center: for the rest, we prepared custom light curves from the full-frame images with our own differential photometric FITSH pipeline. Our main goal was to explore the potential and the limitations of TESS concerning the various subtypes of Cepheids. We detected many low-amplitude features: weak modulation, period jitter, and timing variations due to light-time effect. We also report signs of nonradial modes and the first discovery of such a mode in an anomalous Cepheid, the overtone star XZ Cet, which we then confirmed with ground-based multicolor photometric measurements. We prepared a custom photometric solution to minimize saturation effects in the bright fundamental-mode classical Cepheid, β Dor with the lightkurve software, and we revealed strong evidence of cycle-to-cycle variations in the star. In several cases, however, fluctuations in the pulsation could not be distinguished from instrumental effects, such as contamination from nearby sources, which also varies between sectors. Finally, we discuss how precise light-curve shapes will be crucial not only for classification purposes but also to determine physical properties of these stars.},

	abstract = {The presence of star-to-star light-element abundance variations (also known as multiple populations, MPs) appears to be ubiquitous within old and massive clusters in the Milky Way and all studied nearby galaxies. Most previous studies have focused on resolved images or spectroscopy of individual stars, although there has been significant effort in the past few years to look for multiple population signatures in integrated light spectroscopy. If proven feasible, integrated light studies offer a potential way to vastly open parameter space, as clusters out to 10s of Mpc can be studied. We use the Na D lines in the integrated spectra of two clusters with similar ages (2-3 Gyr) but very different masses: NGC 1978 (∼3 × 105 M⊙) in the Large Magellanic Cloud and G114 (1.7 × 107 M⊙) in NGC 1316. For NGC 1978, our findings agree with resolved studies of individual stars that did not find evidence for Na spreads. However, for G114, we find clear evidence for the presence of multiple populations. The fact that the same anomalous abundance patterns are found in both the intermediate age and ancient globular clusters lends further support to the notion that young massive clusters are effectively the same as the ancient globular clusters, only separated in age.},

However, the "knee" above which [α/Fe] decreases towards Solar-scaled values occurs at lower metallicities in the dwarfs, implying that GCs follow the same trends seen in field stars.

	abstract = {We measure the star formation efficiency (SFE), the star formation rate (SFR) per unit of gas, in 23 nearby galaxies and compare it with expectations from proposed star formation laws and thresholds. We use H I maps from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and derive H2 maps of CO measured by HERA CO-Line Extragalactic Survey and Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies. We estimate the SFR by combining Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) far-ultraviolet maps and the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) 24 μm maps, infer stellar surface density profiles from SINGS 3.6 μm data, and use kinematics from THINGS. We measure the SFE as a function of the free fall and orbital timescales, midplane gas pressure, stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the effects of stars), the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear, and the ability of a cold phase to form. In spirals, the SFE of H2 alone is nearly constant at (5.25 ± 2.5) × 10-10 yr-1 (equivalent to an H2 depletion time of 1.9 × 109 yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800 pc resolution. Where the interstellar medium (ISM) is mostly H I, however, the SFE decreases with increasing radius in both spiral and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably described by an exponential with scale length 0.2r 25-0.25r 25. We interpret this decline as a strong dependence of giant molecular cloud (GMC) formation on environment. The ratio of molecular-to-atomic gas appears to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure spanning from the H2-dominated to H I-dominated ISM. The radial decline in SFE is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in the free-fall time or orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale instability suggest that our disks are stable or marginally stable and do not show a clear link to the declining SFE. We suggest that ISM physics below the scales that we observe—phase balance in the H I, H2 formation and destruction, and stellar feedback—governs the formation of GMCs from H I.},

E-MOSAICS couples a detailed physical model for the formation, evolution, and disruption of star clusters to the EAGLE galaxy formation simulations. This enables following the co-formation and co-evolution of galaxies and their star cluster populations, thus realizing the long-standing promise of using globular clusters (GCs) as tracers of galaxy formation and assembly. The simulations show that the age-metallicity distributions of GC populations exhibit strong galaxy-to-galaxy variations, resulting from differences in their evolutionary histories. We develop a formalism for systematically constraining the assembly histories of galaxies using GC age-metallicity distributions. These distributions are characterized through 13 metrics that we correlate with 30 quantities describing galaxy formation and assembly (e.g. halo properties, formation/assembly redshifts, stellar mass assembly time-scales, galaxy merger statistics), resulting in 20 statistically (highly) significant correlations. The GC age-metallicity distribution is a sensitive probe of the mass growth, metal enrichment, and minor merger history of the host galaxy. No such relation is found between GCs and major mergers, which play a sub-dominant role in GC formation for Milky-Way-mass galaxies. Finally, we show how the GC age-metallicity distribution enables the reconstruction of the host galaxy's merger tree, allowing us to identify all progenitors with masses M\_*≳ 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_☉ for redshifts 1 ≤ z ≤ 2.5. These results demonstrate that cosmological simulations of the co-formation and co-evolution of GCs and their host galaxies successfully unlock the potential of GCs as quantitative tracers of galaxy formation and assembly.},

Based on a quantitative comparison of the Galactic GC population to the 25 cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW-mass galaxies in the E-MOSAICS project, which self-consistently model the formation and evolution of GC populations in a cosmological context, we find that the MW assembled quickly for its mass, reaching \{25, 50\} per cent of its present-day halo mass already at z = \{3, 1.5\} and half of its present-day stellar mass at z = 1.2. We reconstruct the MW's merger tree from its GC age-metallicity distribution, inferring the number of mergers as a function of mass ratio and redshift. These statistics place the MW's assembly rate among the 72th-94th percentile of the E-MOSAICS galaxies, whereas its integrated properties (e.g. number of mergers, halo concentration) match the median of the simulations. We conclude that the MW has experienced no major mergers (mass ratios {\textgreater}1:4) since z ∼ 4, sharpening previous limits of z ∼ 2. We identify three massive satellite progenitors and constrain their mass growth and enrichment histories. Two are proposed to correspond to Sagittarius (a few 108 M☉) and the GCs formerly associated with Canis Major (∼ 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_☉). The third satellite has no known associated relic and was likely accreted between z = 0.6 and 1.3. We name this enigmatic galaxy Kraken and propose that it is the most massive satellite (M\_*∼ 2× 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_☉) ever accreted by the MW. We predict that ∼40 per cent of the Galactic GCs formed ex situ (in galaxies with masses M* = 2 × 107-2× 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_☉), with 6 ± 1 being former nuclear clusters.},

We fit HST NUV to NIR broad-band and H α fluxes to derive star cluster ages, masses, and extinctions and determine the star formation rate (SFR) of six merging galaxies. These systems are excellent laboratories to trace cluster formation under extreme gas physical conditions, rare in the local Universe, but typical for star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We detect clusters with ages of 1-500 Myr and masses that exceed 107 M⊙. The recent cluster formation history and their distribution within the host galaxies suggest that systems such as NGC 34, NGC 1614, and NGC 4194 are close to their final coalescing phase, while NGC 3256, NGC 3690, and NGC 6052 are at an earlier/intermediate stage. A Bayesian analysis of the cluster mass function in the age interval 1-100 Myr provides strong evidence in four of the six galaxies that an exponentially truncated power law better describes the observed mass distributions. For two galaxies, the fits are inconclusive due to low number statistics. We determine power-law slopes β ∼ -1.5 to -2.0 and truncation masses, Mc, between 106 and a few times 107 M⊙, among the highest values reported in the literature. Advanced mergers have higher Mc than early/intermediate merger stage galaxies, suggesting rapid changes in the dense gas conditions during the merger. We compare the total stellar mass in clusters to the SFR of the galaxy, finding that these systems are among the most efficient environments to form star clusters in the local Universe.},

The cluster system exhibits an age-metallicity relation; the youngest clusters are the most metal rich. When compared to H I data, clusters with [M/H] ∼ -1.0 and younger than ∼4 Gyr are clearly identified as a disc population. The clusters show evidence for strong time evolution in the disc radial metallicity gradient (d[M/H]dt/dR = 0.03 dex kpc-1 Gyr-1). The oldest clusters have stronger, more negative gradients than the youngest clusters in M33. The clusters also show a clear age-velocity dispersion relation. The line-of-sight velocity dispersions of the clusters increases with age similar to Milky Way open clusters and stars. The general shape of the relation is reproduced by disc heating simulations, and the similarity between the relations in M33 and the Milky Way suggests that heating by substructure and cooling of the interstellar medium both play a role in shaping this relation. We identify 12 `classical' GCs, six of which are newly identified GC candidates. The GCs are more metal rich than Milky Way halo clusters, and show weak rotation. The inner (R {\textless} 4.5 kpc) GCs exhibit a steep radial metallicity gradient (d[M/H]/dR = -0.29 ± 0.11 dex kpc-1) and an exponential-like surface density profile. We argue that these inner GCs are thick disc rather than halo objects.},

A new catalog of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) has a completeness limit of 1.3×105 Msolar.

Beyond that radius, GMCs are nearly absent, although molecular gas exists. Most (90\%) of the emission from low-mass clouds is found within 100 pc projected separation of a GMC. In an annulus 2.1 kpcgal{\textless}4.1 kpc, GMC masses follow a power-law distribution with index -2.1. Inside that radius, the mass distribution is truncated, and clouds more massive than 8×105 Msolar are absent. The cloud mass distribution shows no significant difference in the grand-design spiral arms versus the interarm region. The CO surface brightness ratio for the arm to interarm regions is 1.5, typical of other flocculent galaxies.},

	abstract = {We utilize the multi-wavelength data of M33 to study the origin of turbulence in its interstellar medium. We find that the H I turbulent energy surface density inside 8 kpc is ∼1-3 × 1046 erg pc-2, and has no strong dependence on galactocentric radius because of the lack of variation in H I surface density and H I velocity dispersion. Then, we consider the energies injected by supernovae (SNe), the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and the gravity-driven turbulence from accreted materials as the sources of turbulent energy. For a constant dissipation time of turbulence, the SNe energy can maintain turbulence inside ∼4 kpc radius (equivalent to ∼0.5 R 25), while the MRI energy is always smaller than the turbulent energy within 8 kpc radius. However, when we let the dissipation time to be equal to the crossing time of turbulence across the H I scale height, the SNe energy is enough to maintain turbulence out to 7 kpc radius, and the sum of SNe and MRI energies is able to maintain turbulence out to 8 kpc radius. Due to lack of constraint in the mass accretion rate through the disk of M33, we cannot rule out the accretion driven turbulence as a possible source of energy. Furthermore, by resolving individual giant molecular clouds in M33, we also show that the SNe energy can maintain turbulence within individual molecular clouds with ∼1\% of coupling efficiency. This result strengthens the proposition that stellar feedback is an important source of energy to maintain turbulence in nearby galaxies.},

The H I observations, combined with H I measurements from the Green Bank Telescope, improve the spectral resolution and sensitivity (2.8 K rms noise in a 0.2 \{km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\} channel) compared to previous observations. We find individual profiles are usually non-Gaussian, harbouring line wings, multiple components, and asymmetries. Given this spectral complexity, we quantify the motions in the atomic interstellar medium through moment analysis of the spectra and fits to aligned, stacked profiles. The measured value of the H I line width depends strongly on the method used, with the velocity stacked profiles aligned to the peak velocity giving the minimum value of σ = 7 \{km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\} and all other methods giving higher values (σ ∼ 10 \{km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}). All measurements of the line width show a shallow radial trend, with σ decreasing by ∼2 \{km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\} from Rgal = 0 to Rgal = 8 kpc. We consider a number of energy sources that might maintain the line width against turbulent dissipation, but no single source is adequate. We find excess emission relative to a Gaussian in the stacked profile line wings, ranging from 9 per cent to 26 per cent depending on how the spectra are aligned. By splitting the line wings into symmetric and asymmetric components, we find that the lagging rotational disc accounts for one-third of the line wing flux. We also find emission far from the rotation-axis of the galaxy in multiple discrete H I clouds, including a filament with a projected length of ∼8 kpc.},

	abstract = {We present a theoretical framework in which bound stellar clusters arise naturally at the high-density end of the hierarchy of the interstellar medium (ISM). Due to short free-fall times, these high-density regions achieve high local star formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound clusters. Star-forming regions of lower density remain substructured and gas-rich, ending up unbound when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the tidal perturbation of star-forming regions by nearby, dense giant molecular clouds imposes a minimum density contrast required for the collapse to a bound cluster. The fraction of all star formation that occurs in bound stellar clusters (the cluster formation efficiency, hereafter CFE) follows by integration of these local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum of the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE as a function of observable galaxy properties, and find that it increases with the gas surface density, from Γ ∼ 1 per cent in low-density galaxies to a peak value of Γ ∼ 70 per cent at densities of Σg ∼ 103 M⊙ pc-2. This explains the observation that the CFE increases with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf, spiral and starburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our model results with observed galaxies yields excellent agreement. The model is applied further by calculating the spatial variation of the CFE within single galaxies. We also consider the variation of the CFE with cosmic time and show that it increases with redshift, peaking in high-redshift, gas-rich disc galaxies. It is estimated that up to 30-35 per cent of all stars in the Universe once formed in bound stellar clusters. We discuss how our theory can be verified with Gaia and ALMA, and provide possible implementations for theoretical work and for simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

We aim at reaching consensus on the best, most homogeneous, and internally most consistent set of Local Group distance moduli to adopt for future, more general use based on the largest set of distance determinations to individual Local Group galaxies available to date. Based on a careful, statistically weighted combination of the main stellar population tracers (Cepheids, RR Lyrae variables, and the magnitude of the tip of the red-giant branch), we derive a recommended distance modulus to M31 of (m-M)\_0{\textasciicircum}M31 = 24.46 +/- 0.10 mag—adopting as our calibration an LMC distance modulus of (m-M)\_0{\textasciicircum}LMC = 18.50 mag—and a fully internally consistent set of benchmark distances to key galaxies in the local volume, enabling us to establish a robust and unbiased, near-field extragalactic distance ladder.},

	abstract = {I describe a Bayesian method to account for measurement errors in linear regression of astronomical data. The method allows for heteroscedastic and possibly correlated measurement errors and intrinsic scatter in the regression relationship. The method is based on deriving a likelihood function for the measured data, and I focus on the case when the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables can be approximated using a mixture of Gaussian functions. I generalize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables, nondetections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampler is described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of the parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the method with other common estimators. The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give constraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors dominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussian functions. I conclude by using this method to fit the X-ray spectral slope as a function of Eddington ratio using a sample of 39 z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.8 radio-quiet quasars. I confirm the correlation seen by other authors between the radio-quiet quasar X-ray spectral slope and the Eddington ratio, where the X-ray spectral slope softens as the Eddington ratio increases.

	abstract = {We present a large set of theoretical isochrones, whose distinctive features mostly reside on the greatly-improved treatment of the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. Essentially, we have coupled the TP-AGB tracks described in Paper I, at their stages of pre-flash quiescent H-shell burning, with the evolutionary tracks for the previous evolutionary phases from Girardi et al. (2000, A\&amp;AS, 141, 371). Theoretical isochrones for any intermediate value of age and metallicity are then derived by interpolation in the grids. We take care that the isochrones keep, to a good level of detail, the several peculiarities present in these TP-AGB tracks - e.g., the cool tails of C-type stars owing to the use of proper molecular opacities as convective dredge-up occurs along the TP-AGB; the bell-shaped sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram for stars with hot-bottom burning; the changes of pulsation mode between fundamental and first overtone; the sudden changes of mean mass-loss rates as the surface chemistry changes from M- to C-type; etc. Theoretical isochrones are then converted to about 20 different photometric systems - including traditional ground-based systems, and those of recent major wide-field surveys such as SDSS, OGLE, DENIS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, etc., - by means of synthetic photometry applied to an updated library of stellar spectra, suitably extended to include C-type stars. Finally, we correct the predicted photometry for the effect of circumstellar dust during the mass-losing stages of the AGB evolution, which allows us to improve the results for the optical-to-infrared systems, and to simulate mid- and far-IR systems such as those of Spitzer and AKARI. We illustrate the most striking properties of these isochrones by means of basic comparisons with observational data for the Milky Way disc and the Magellanic Clouds. Access to the data is provided both via a web repository of static tables (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/dustyAGB07 and CDS), and via an interactive web interface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd), which provides tables for any intermediate value of age and metallicity, for several photometric systems, and for different choices of dust properties.},

We find a central abundance of 12 + log (O/H) = 8.36 +/- 0.04 and a slope of -0.027 +/- 0.012 dex kpc-1, in agreement with infrared measurements of the neon abundance gradient but much shallower than most previous oxygen gradient measurements. There is substantial intrinsic scatter of 0.11 dex in the metallicity at any given radius in M33, which imposes a fundamental limit on the accuracy of gradient measurements that rely on small samples of objects. We also show that the ionization state of neon does not follow the ionization state of oxygen as is commonly assumed, suggesting that neon abundance measurements from optical emission lines require careful treatment of the ionization corrections.

The wavelength coverage spans the ultraviolet to the infrared (1500 Å-24 μm) which is utilized to derive global physical properties (i.e. star formation rate, stellar mass, internal extinction due to dust). With these data, we find colour-colour relationships and correlated trends between observed and physical properties (i.e. optical magnitudes and dust properties, optical colour and specific star formation rate, and ultraviolet-infrared colour and metallicity). The SEDs are binned by different galaxy properties to reveal how each property affects the observed shape of these SEDs. In addition, due to the volume-limited nature of LVL, we utilize the dwarf-dominated galaxy sample to test star formation relationships established with higher mass galaxy samples. We find good agreement with the star-forming `main-sequence' relationship, but find a systematic deviation in the infrared `main sequence' at low luminosities. This deviation is attributed to suppressed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation in low-metallicity environments and/or the destruction of PAHs in more intense radiation fields occurring near a suggested threshold in star formation rates (sSFR) at a value of log(sSFR) ∼ -10.2.},

Given the vertical velocity dispersion of stars and disc scale height, the disc surface mass density and hence the M/L can be estimated. We address a conceptual problem with previous measurements of the scale height and dispersion. When using this method, the dispersion and scale height must refer to the same population of stars. The scale height is obtained from near-infrared (IR) studies of edge-on galaxies and is weighted towards older kinematically hotter stars, whereas the dispersion obtained from integrated light in the optical bands includes stars of all ages. We aim to extract the dispersion for the hotter stars, so that it can then be used with the correct scale height to obtain the disc surface mass density. We use a sample of planetary nebulae (PNe) as dynamical tracers in the face-on galaxy NGC 628. We extract two different dispersions from its velocity histogram - representing the older and younger PNe. We also present complementary stellar absorption spectra in the inner regions of this galaxy and use a direct pixel fitting technique to extract the two components. Our analysis concludes that previous studies, which do not take account of the young disc, underestimate the disc surface mass density by a factor of ∼2. This is sufficient to make a maximal disc for NGC 628 appear like a submaximal disc.},

	abstract = {Photoelectric UBV photometry and star counts are presented for the previously unstudied open cluster Collinder 236, supplemented by observations for stars near the Cepheid WZ Car. Collinder 236 is typical of groups associated with Cepheids, with an evolutionary age of (3.4+-1.1)x10{\textasciicircum}7 years, but it is 1944+-71 pc distant, only half the predicted distance to WZ Car. The cluster is reddened by E(B-V){\textasciitilde}0.26, and has nuclear and coronal radii of rn{\textasciitilde}2 arcmin (1.1 pc) and Rc{\textasciitilde}8 arcmin (4.5 pc), respectively. The Cepheid is not a member of Collinder 236 on the basis of location beyond the cluster tidal radius and implied distance, but its space reddening can be established as E(B-V)=0.268+-0.006 s.e. from 5 adjacent stars. Period changes in WZ Car studied with the aid of archival data are revised. The period of WZ Car is increasing, its rate of +8.27+-0.19 s yr{\textasciicircum}(-1) being consistent with a third crossing of the instability strip.},

	abstract = {Context. The ESA Gaia mission provides a unique time-domain survey for more than 1.6 billion sources with G ≲ 21 mag. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We showcase stellar variability in the Galactic colour-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD). We focus on pulsating, eruptive, and cataclysmic variables, as well as on stars that exhibit variability that is due to rotation and eclipses. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We describe the locations of variable star classes, variable object fractions, and typical variability amplitudes throughout the CaMD and show how variability-related changes in colour and brightness induce "motions". To do this, we use 22 months of calibrated photometric, spectro-photometric, and astrometric Gaia data of stars with a significant parallax. To ensure that a large variety of variable star classes populate the CaMD, we crossmatched Gaia sources with known variable stars. We also used the statistics and variability detection modules of the Gaia variability pipeline. Corrections for interstellar extinction are not implemented in this article. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Gaia enables the first investigation of Galactic variable star populations in the CaMD on a similar, if not larger, scale as was previously done in the Magellanic Clouds. Although the observed colours are not corrected for reddening, distinct regions are visible in which variable stars occur. We determine variable star fractions to within the current detection thresholds of Gaia. Finally, we report the most complete description of variability-induced motion within the CaMD to date. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia enables novel insights into variability phenomena for an unprecedented number of stars, which will benefit the understanding of stellar astrophysics. The CaMD of Galactic variable stars provides crucial information on physical origins of variability in a way that has previously only been accessible for Galactic star clusters or external galaxies. Future Gaia data releases will enable significant improvements over this preview by providing longer time series, more accurate astrometry, and additional data types (time series BP and RP spectra, RVS spectra, and radial velocities), all for much larger samples of stars. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}A movie associated to Fig. 11 is available at {\textless}A href="https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833304/olm"{\textgreater}https://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}.Data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/623/A110"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/623/A110{\textless}/A{\textgreater}.},

Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M ⊙ stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical structure in gas and young stars produces clusters in high-density regions where the individual stellar orbits rapidly mix. For a fixed density at the onset of gas collapse (e.g. determined by changes in the ionization equilibrium and grain properties), the efficiency of star formation is automatically high in the high-density regions of giant molecular clouds. Thus, bound cluster formation follows somewhat trivially from hierarchical structure. The density where the efficiency is high enough to produce a bound cluster depends on the dispersion of the density probability distribution function (pdf), decreasing for higher dispersions and making bound cluster formation more likely. Similarly, the mass fraction of star formation in the form of bound clusters increases with the pdf dispersion. Because this dispersion is related to the turbulent Mach number, and also to the interstellar medium pressure and star-formation rate per unit volume, it follows that high-pressure or highly active regions tend to produce bound clusters, while low-pressure and inactive regions tend to produce stars in unbound associations.},

	abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are usually accompanied by lower-mass clusters and unbound stars with a total mass equal to several tens times the mass of the YMC. If this was also true when globular clusters (GCs) formed, then their cosmic density implies that most star formation before redshift ∼2 made a GC that lasted until today. Star-forming regions had to change after this time for the modern universe to be making very few YMCs. Here we consider the conditions needed for the formation of a ∼106 M ⊙ cluster. These include a star formation rate (SFR) inside each independent region that exceeds ∼1 M ⊙ yr-1 to sample the cluster mass function up to such a high mass, and an SFR per unit area of ΣSFR ∼ 1 M ⊙ kpc-2 yr-1 to get the required high gas surface density from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and therefore the required high pressure from the weight of the gas. High pressures are implied by the virial theorem at cluster densities. The ratio of these two quantities gives the area of a GC-forming region, ∼1 kpc2, and the young stellar mass converted to a cloud mass gives a typical gas surface density of 500-1000 M ⊙ pc-2. Observations of star-forming clumps in young galaxies are consistent with these numbers, suggesting that they formed today’s GCs. Observations of the cluster cutoff mass in local galaxies agree with the maximum mass calculated from ΣSFR. Metal-poor stellar populations in local dwarf irregular galaxies confirm the dominant role of GC formation in building their young disks.},

	abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Δα{\textasciitilde}0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto \& Zoccali; Paresce \& De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; Méndez \& Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

We derive the cluster parameters using a method that takes into account the stochasticity problem, presented in previous papers of this series. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The derived differential age distribution of the M 33 cluster population is composed of a two-slope profile indicating that the number of clusters decreases when age gets older. The first slope is interpreted as the evolutionary fading phase of the cluster magnitudes, and the second slope as the cluster disruption. The threshold between these two phases occurs at {\textasciitilde}300 Myr, comparable to what is observed in the M 31 galaxy. We also model by use of artificial clusters the ability of the cluster physical parameter derivation method to correctly derive the two-slope profile for different photometric systems tested. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Figures 2, 5-8 are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526544/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Orion Star-forming Complex (OSFC) is a central target for the APOGEE-2 Young Cluster Survey. Existing membership catalogs span limited portions of the OSFC, reflecting the difficulty of selecting targets homogeneously across this extended, highly structured region. We have used data from wide-field photometric surveys to produce a less biased parent sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) with infrared (IR) excesses indicative of warm circumstellar material or photometric variability at optical wavelengths across the full 420 square degree extent of the OSFC. When restricted to YSO candidates with H {\textless} 12.4, to ensure S/N ∼ 100 for a six-visit source, this uniformly selected sample includes 1307 IR excess sources selected using criteria vetted by Koenig \& Liesawitz (2014) and 990 optical variables identified in the Pan-STARRS1 3π survey: 319 sources exhibit both optical variability and evidence of circumstellar disks through IR excess. Objects from this uniformly selected sample received the highest priority for targeting, but required fewer than half of the fibers on each APOGEE-2 plate. We filled the remaining fibers with previously confirmed and new color-magnitude selected candidate OSFC members. Radial velocity measurements from APOGEE-1 and new APOGEE-2 observations taken in the survey’s first year indicate that ∼90\% of the uniformly selected targets have radial velocities consistent with Orion membership. The APOGEE-2 Orion survey will include {\textgreater}1100 bona fide YSOs whose uniform selection function will provide a robust sample for comparative analyses of the stellar populations and properties across all sub-regions of Orion.},

	abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than ∼100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than ∼10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters.

In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

	abstract = {We review the formation and early evolution of the most massive ({\textgreater} few 104 M⊙) and dense (radius of a few parsecs) young stellar clusters, focusing on the role that studies of these objects in our Galaxy can play in our understanding of star and planet formation as a whole. Comparing the demographics of young massive cluster (YMC) progenitor clouds and YMCs across the Galaxy shows that gas in the Galactic Center can accumulate to a high enough density that molecular clouds already satisfy the criteria used to define YMCs, without forming stars. In this case formation can proceed in situ — i.e., the stars form at protostellar densities close to the final stellar density. Conversely, in the disk, the gas either begins forming stars while it is being accumulated to high density, in a "conveyor belt" mode, or the timescale to accumulate the gas to such high densities must be much shorter than the star-formation timescale. The distinction between the formation regimes in the two environments is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent density thresholds for star formation. This implies that stars in YMCs of similar total mass and radius can have formed at widely different initial protostellar densities. The fact that no strong, systematic variations in fundamental properties (such as the IMF) are observed between YMCs in the disk and Galactic Center suggests that, statistically speaking, stellar mass assembly is not affected by the initial protostellar density. We then review recent theoretical advances and summarize the debate on three key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution, infant (im)mortality, and age spreads within YMCs. We conclude that (1) the initial protostellar distribution is likely hierarchical, (2) YMCs likely experienced a formation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion rather than gas expulsion, (3) YMCs are dynamically stable from a young age, and (4) YMCs have age spreads much smaller than their mean age. Finally, we show that it is plausible that metal-rich globular clusters may have formed in a similar way to YMCs in nearby galaxies. In summary, the study of YMC formation bridges star/planet formation in the solar neighborhood to the oldest structures in the local universe.},

	abstract = {Owing to recent advances in radial-velocity instrumentation and observation techniques, the detection of Earth-mass planets around Sun-like stars may soon be primarily limited by intrinsic stellar variability. Several processes contribute to this variability, including starspots, pulsations, and granulation. Although many previous studies have focused on techniques to mitigate signals from pulsations and other types of magnetic activity, granulation noise has to date only been partially addressed by empirically-motivated observation strategies and magnetohydrodynamic simulations. To address this deficit, we present the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator (\${\textbackslash}texttt\{GRASS\}\$), a new tool designed to create time-series synthetic spectra with granulation-driven variability from spatially- and temporally-resolved observations of solar absorption lines. In this work, we present \${\textbackslash}texttt\{GRASS\}\$, detail its methodology, and validate its model against disk-integrated solar observations. As a first-of-its-kind empirical model for spectral variability due to granulation in a star with perfectly known center-of-mass radial-velocity behavior, \${\textbackslash}texttt\{GRASS\}\$ is an important tool for testing new methods of disentangling granular line-shape changes from true Doppler shifts.},

We find a weak detection at \{M\}* ∼ \{10\}5 \{M\}⊙ in one case (M51) and strong evidence against this value in two cases.

Our data are generally consistent with much larger cutoffs, at \{M\}* ∼ \{few\}× \{10\}6 \{M\}⊙ .

We present LBT MODS observations of 62 H ii regions in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628, with an unprecedentedly large number of auroral lines measurements (18 [O iii] λ4363, 29 [N ii] λ5755, 40 [S iii]λ6312, and 40 [O ii] λλ7320, 7330 detections) in 45 H ii regions. Comparing derived temperatures from multiple auroral line measurements, we find: (1) a strong correlation between temperatures based on [S iii] λ6312 and [N ii] λ5755 and (2) large discrepancies for some temperatures based on [O ii] λλ7320, 7330 and [O iii] λ4363. Both of these trends are consistent with other observations in the literature, yet, given the widespread use and acceptance of [O iii] λ4363 as a temperature determinant, the magnitude of the T[O iii] discrepancies still came as a surprise. Based on these results, we conduct a uniform abundance analysis prioritizing the temperatures derived from [S iii] λ6312 and [N ii] λ5755, and report the gas-phase abundance gradients for NGC 628. Relative abundances of S/O, Ne/O, and Ar/O are constant across the galaxy, consistent with no systematic change in the upper IMF over the sampled range in metallicity. These alpha-element ratios, along with N/O, all show small dispersions (σ ∼ 0.1 dex) over 70\% of the azimuthally averaged radius. We interpret these results as an indication that, at a given radius, the interstellar medium in NGC 628 is chemically well-mixed. Unlike the gradients in the nearly temperature-independent relative abundances, O/H abundances have a larger intrinsic dispersion of ∼0.165 dex. We posit that this dispersion represents an upper limit to the true dispersion in O/H at a given radius and that some of that dispersion is due to systematic uncertainties arising from temperature measurements.},

	abstract = {We present a new catalog and results for the cluster system of the starburst galaxy NGC 4449, based on multiband imaging observations taken as part of the LEGUS and Hα-LEGUS surveys. We improve the spectral energy fitting method used to estimate cluster ages, and find that the results, particularly for older clusters, are in better agreement with those from spectroscopy. The inclusion of Hα measurements, the role of stochasticity for low-mass clusters, the assumptions about reddening, and the choices of SSP model and metallicity all have important impacts on the age dating of clusters. A comparison with ages derived from stellar color-magnitude diagrams for partially resolved clusters shows reasonable agreement, but large scatter in some cases. The fraction of light found in clusters relative to the total light (I.e., TL) in the U, B, and V filters in 25 different ≈ kiloparsec-size regions throughout NGC 4449 correlates with both the specific region luminosity, RL, and the dominant age of the underlying stellar population in each region. The observed cluster age distribution is found to decline over time as dN/dτ ∝ τγ, with γ = -0.85 ± 0.15, independent of cluster mass, and is consistent with strong, early cluster disruption. The mass functions of the clusters can be described by a power law with dN/dM ∝ Mβ and β = -1.86 ± 0.2, independent of cluster age. The mass and age distributions are quite resilient to differences in age-dating methods. There is tentative evidence for a factor of 2-3 enhancement in both the star and cluster formation rate ≈100-300 Myr ago, indicating that cluster formation tracks star formation generally. The enhancement is probably associated with an earlier interaction event.},

	abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

The analysis yields stellar effective temperatures, gravities, interstellar reddening, and extinction, the combination of which provides a distance estimate via the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationship (FGLR). This result is based on an FGLR calibration that is continually being polished. An average reddening of langE(B - V)rang {\textasciitilde} 0.08 mag is found, with a large variation ranging from 0.01 to 0.16 mag, however, demonstrating the importance of accurate individual reddening measurements for stellar distance indicators in galaxies with evident signatures of interstellar absorption. The large-distance modulus found is in good agreement with recent work on eclipsing binaries, planetary nebulae, long-period variables, RR Lyrae stars, and also with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Cepheids, if reasonable reddening assumptions are made for the Cepheids. Since distances based on the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method found in the literature give conflicting results, we have used HST Advanced Camera for Surveys V- and I-band images of outer regions of M33 to determine a TRGB distance of 24.84 ± 0.10 mag, in basic agreement with the FGLR result. We have also determined stellar metallicities and discussed the metallicity gradient in the disk of M33. We find metallicity of Z sun at the center and 0.3 Z sun in the outskirts at a distance of one isophotal radius. The average logarithmic metallicity gradient is -0.07 ± 0.01 dex kpc-1. However, there is a large scatter around this average value, very similar to what has been found for the H II regions in M33.},

We assume that in an annulus of an isolated self-regulated radially exponential axially symmetric disc galaxy, the local mass function of very young (embedded) clusters is a power law with an upper mass limit which depends on the local star formation rate density. Radial integration of this mass function yields a galaxy-wide embedded cluster mass function. This integrated embedded cluster mass function has a Schechter-type form, which results from the addition of many low-mass clusters forming at all galactocentric distances and rarer massive clusters only forming close to the centre of the galaxy.},

	abstract = {Using recently acquired Hubble Space Telescope NIR observations (J, Paβ, and H bands) of the nearby galaxy NGC 1313, we investigate the timescales required by a young star cluster to emerge from its natal cloud. We search for extincted star clusters, potentially embedded in their natal cloud as either (1) compact sources in regions with high Hα/Paβ extinctions or (2) compact H II regions that appear as point-like sources in the Paβ emission map. The NUV-optical-NIR photometry of the candidate clusters is used to derive their ages, masses, and extinctions via a least-χ2 spectral energy distribution broad- and narrowband fitting process. The 100 clusters in the final samples have masses in the range \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\}\_\{10\}(M/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \})=2.5{\textbackslash}mbox\{--\}3.5\$ and moderate extinctions, E(B - V) ≲ 1.0 mag. Focusing on the young clusters (0-6 Myr), we derive a weak correlation between extinction and age of the clusters. Almost half of the clusters have low extinctions, E(B - V) {\textless} 0.25 mag, already at very young ages (≤3 Myr), suggesting that dust is quickly removed from clusters. A stronger correlation is found between the morphology of the nebular emission (compact, partial or absent, both in Hα and Paβ) and cluster age. Relative fractions of clusters associated with a specific nebular morphology are used to estimate the typical timescales for clearing the natal gas cloud, resulting in between 3 and 5 Myr, ∼1 Myr older than what was estimated from NUV-optical-based cluster studies. This difference hints at a bias for optical-only-based studies, which James Webb Space Telescope will address in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Photometric measurements are prone to systematic errors presenting a challenge to low-amplitude variability detection. In search for a general-purpose variability detection technique able to recover a broad range of variability types including currently unknown ones, we test 18 statistical characteristics quantifying scatter and/or correlation between brightness measurements. We compare their performance in identifying variable objects in seven time series data sets obtained with telescopes ranging in size from a telephoto lens to 1 m-class and probing variability on time-scales from minutes to decades. The test data sets together include light curves of 127 539 objects, among them 1251 variable stars of various types and represent a range of observing conditions often found in ground-based variability surveys. The real data are complemented by simulations. We propose a combination of two indices that together recover a broad range of variability types from photometric data characterized by a wide variety of sampling patterns, photometric accuracies and percentages of outlier measurements. The first index is the interquartile range (IQR) of magnitude measurements, sensitive to variability irrespective of a time-scale and resistant to outliers. It can be complemented by the ratio of the light-curve variance to the mean square successive difference, 1/η, which is efficient in detecting variability on time-scales longer than the typical time interval between observations. Variable objects have larger 1/η and/or IQR values than non-variable objects of similar brightness. Another approach to variability detection is to combine many variability indices using principal component analysis. We present 124 previously unknown variable stars found in the test data.},

We find that the fraction of stars with variability greater than that of the Sun is 60\%, which is marginally consistent with previous studies, and confirm the trend of increasing variability with decreasing effective temperatures. We define low and high variability samples, with a cut corresponding to twice the variability level of the active Sun, and compare the properties of the stars belonging to each sample. We show tentative evidence that the more active stars have lower proper motions and may be located closer to the galactic plane. We also investigate the frequency content of the variability, finding clear evidence for periodic or quasi-periodic behaviour in 16\% of stars, and showing that there exist significant differences in the nature of variability between spectral types. Of the periodic objects, most A and F stars have short periods (\&lt;2 days) and highly sinusoidal variability, suggestive of pulsations, whilst G, K and M stars tend to have longer periods (\&gt;5 days, with a trend towards longer periods at later spectral types) and show a mixture of periodic and stochastic variability, indicative of activity. Finally, we use auto-regressive models to characterise the stochastic component of the variability, and show that its typical amplitude and time-scale both increase towards later spectral types, which we interpret as a corresponding increase in the characteristic size and life-time of active regions.},

	abstract = {A large collective effort to study the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over the past decade has led to a number of fundamental results on radio-quiet AGN and blazars. In radio-quiet AGN, the ultraviolet (UV) bump in low-luminosity objects is thermal emission from a dense medium, very probably an accretion disk, irradiated by the variable X-ray source. The validity of this model for high-luminosity radio-quiet AGN is unclear because the relevant UV and X-ray observations are lacking. The broad-line gas kinematics appears to be dominated by virialized motions in the gravity field of a black hole, whose mass can be derived from the observed motions. The “accretion disk plus wind” model explains most of the variability (and other) data and appears to be the most appropriate model at present. Future investigations are outlined. In blazars, rapid variability at the highest energies (gamma-rays) implies that the whole continuum is relativistically boosted along the line of sight. The general correlation found between variations in TeV gamma rays and in X rays for Mrk 421, and between variations in GeV gamma rays and in the IR–optical–UV bands for 3C 279, two prototype objects, supports models in which the same population of relativistic electrons radiates the low-frequency continuum via synchrotron and the high frequency continuum via inverse Compton scattering of soft photons. Identifying the dominant source of soft photons, which is at present unclear, will strongly constrain the jet physics.},

	abstract = {We present a new study of the spatial distribution and ages of the star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). To detect and estimate the ages of the star clusters we rely on the new fully automated method developed by Bitsakis et al. Our code detects 1319 star clusters in the central 18 deg2 of the SMC we surveyed (1108 of which have never been reported before). The age distribution of those clusters suggests enhanced cluster formation around 240 Myr ago. It also implies significant differences in the cluster distribution of the bar with respect to the rest of the galaxy, with the younger clusters being predominantly located in the bar. Having used the same setup, and data from the same surveys as for our previous study of the LMC, we are able to robustly compare the cluster properties between the two galaxies. Our results suggest that the bulk of the clusters in both galaxies were formed approximately 300 Myr ago, probably during a direct collision between the two galaxies. On the other hand, the locations of the young (≤50 Myr) clusters in both Magellanic Clouds, found where their bars join the H I arms, suggest that cluster formation in those regions is a result of internal dynamical processes. Finally, we discuss the potential causes of the apparent outside-in quenching of cluster formation that we observe in the SMC. Our findings are consistent with an evolutionary scheme where the interactions between the Magellanic Clouds constitute the major mechanism driving their overall evolution.},

For the LMC, we used a constant distance modulus of (m-M)\_0 = 18.50 and a metallicity of Z = 0.008. For both galaxies, we used a variable color excess to derive the cluster ages. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find two periods of enhanced cluster formation in both galaxies at 160 Myr and 630 Myr (SMC) and at 125 Myr and 800 Myr (LMC). We present the spatially resolved recent star formation history of both Clouds based on young star clusters. The first peak may have been triggered by a close encounter between the SMC and the LMC. In both galaxies, the youngest clusters reside in the supergiant shells, giant shells, the intershell regions, and toward regions with a high Hα content, suggesting that their formation is related to expansion and shell-shell interaction. Most of the clusters are older than the dynamical age of the supergiant shells. No evidence of cluster dissolution was found. Computed V band luminosities show a trend toward fainter magnitudes with increasing age, as well as a trend toward brighter magnitudes with increasing apparent cluster radii. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Tables 1 and 2 are only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/517/A50"{\textgreater}http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/517/A50{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is one of the nearest galaxies to us and is one of only few galaxies where the star formation history can be determined from studying resolved stellar populations. We have compiled a new catalogue of ages, luminosities and masses of LMC star clusters and used it to determine the age distribution and dissolution rate of LMC star clusters. We find that the frequency of massive clusters with masses M {\textgreater} 5000 M⊙ is almost constant between 10 and 200 Myr, showing that the influence of residual gas expulsion is limited to the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution or clusters less massive than 5000 M⊙. Comparing the cluster frequency in that interval with the absolute star formation rate, we find that about 15 per cent of all stars in the LMC were formed in long-lived star clusters that survive for more than 10 Myr. We also find that the mass function of LMC clusters younger than 109 Gyr can be fitted by a power-law mass function N(m) ∼ m-α with slope α = 2.3, while older clusters follow a significantly shallower slope and interpret that this is a sign of either incompleteness or the ongoing dissolution of low-mass clusters. Our data show that for ages older than 200 Myr, about 90 per cent of all clusters are lost per dex of lifetime. The implied cluster dissolution rate is significantly faster than that based on analytic estimates and N-body simulations. Our cluster age data finally show evidence for a burst in cluster formation about 109 yr ago, but little evidence for bursts at other ages.},

	abstract = {We present a new framework to detect various types of variable objects within massive astronomical time series data. Assuming that the dominant population of objects is non-variable, we find outliers from this population by using a non-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm based on an infinite Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the Dirichlet process. The algorithm extracts information from a given data set, which is described by six variability indices. The GMM uses those variability indices to recover clusters that are described by six-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions, allowing our approach to consider the sampling pattern of time series data, systematic biases, the number of data points for each light curve and photometric quality. Using the Northern Sky Variability Survey data, we test our approach and prove that the infinite GMM is useful at detecting variable objects, while providing statistical inference estimation that suppresses false detection. The proposed approach will be effective in the exploration of future surveys such as Gaia, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will produce massive time series data.},

We determine membership probabilities by following a Bayesian approach using spatial and kinematic information of the potential cluster-Cepheid pairs. We confirm 19 Cepheid-cluster associations considered in previous studies as bona fide, and question the established cluster membership of six other associations. In addition, we identify 138 cluster Cepheid candidates of potential interest, mostly in recently discovered open clusters. We report on at least two new clusters possibly hosting more than one Cepheid. Furthermore, we explore the feasibility of using open clusters hosting Cepheids to empirically determine the Cepheid period-age relation through the use of Gaia and 2MASS photometry and a semiautomated method to derive cluster ages. We conclude that the usage of cluster Cepheids as tentative probes of the period-age relations still faces difficulties due to the sparsely populated red giant branch and the stochastically sampled main-sequence turn-off of the open clusters, making age determinations a challenging task. This biases the age-datable cluster selection for Cepheid period-age studies towards older and high-mass clusters.},

The photometry reaches a completeness-limited depth of F475W∼28.5 in the lowest surface density regions observed in M33 and F475W∼26.5 in the most crowded regions found near the center of M33.

This enabled the discovery of thousands of new exoplanets, and the characterization of myriad astrophysical phenomena. However, one of the challenges with interpreting Kepler data has been that no instrument has provided a comparison dataset. Therefore, the replication of Kepler time-series data has remained elusive. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) launched in April 2018 and began science operations in July 2018. During the TESS primary mission, it will survey 85\% of the sky. NASA's first two observatories dedicated to discovering exoplanets, Kepler and TESS, were simultaneously operating during 2018. While the Kepler's K2 mission surveyed the ecliptic plane, TESS targets fields outside the ecliptic. However, during September 2018, a small region of the sky was observed simultaneously by both TESS and Kepler as part of TESS's Sector 2 (Aug 22 - Sep 20, 2018) and K2 Campaign 19 (Sep 7 - Sep 26, 2018). The overlap region was 0.5 sq. deg. We identified 171 K2 targets that fell inside TESS Sector 2 field of view, all of which are observed at 30-minute cadence by both missions. The targets range in brightness in the TESS bandpass (Tmag) from 6.7-18.4, with 93 targets brighter than Tmag=15, and 17 brighter than Tmag=12. This dataset provides the first simultaneous, long-duration, high-precision observations of the same targets from different space-based observatories and presents an excellent opportunity to explore instrumental systematics present in the two telescopes.},

	abstract = {Context. Magnetic fields are a key component in the main sequence evolution of low mass stars. Flares, energetic eruptions on the surfaces of stars, are an unmistakable manifestation of magnetically driven emission. The occurrence rates and energy distributions of flares trace stellar characteristics such as mass and age. However, before flares can be used to constrain stellar properties, the flaring-age-mass relation requires proper calibration. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: This work sets out to quantify the flaring activity of independently age-dated main sequence stars for a broad range of spectral types using optical light curves obtained by the Kepler satellite. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Drawing from the complete K2 archive, we searched 3435 ∼80 day long light curves of 2111 open cluster members for flares using the open-source software packages K2SC to remove instrumental and astrophysical variability from K2 light curves, and AltaiPony to search and characterize the flare candidates. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We confirmed a total of 3844 flares on high probability open cluster members with ages from zero age main sequence (Pleiades) to 3.6 Gyr (M 67). We extended the mass range probed in the first study of this series to span from Sun-like stars to mid-M dwarfs. We added the Hyades (690 Myr) to the sample as a comparison cluster to Praesepe (750 Myr), the 2.6 Gyr old Ruprecht 147, and several hundred light curves from the late K2 Campaigns in the remaining clusters. We found that the flare energy distribution was similar in the entire parameter space, following a power law relation with exponent α ≈ 1.84-2.39. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We confirm that flaring rates decline with age, and decline faster for higher mass stars. Our results are in good agreement with most previous statistical flare studies. We find evidence that a rapid decline in flaring activity occurred in M1-M2 dwarfs around the ages of the Hyades and Praesepe, when these stars spun down to rotation periods of about 10 d, while higher mass stars had already transitioned to lower flaring rates and lower mass stars still resided in the saturated activity regime. We conclude that some discrepancies between our results and flare studies that used rotation periods for their age estimates could be explained by sample selection bias toward more active stars, but others may point to the limitations of using rotation as an age indicator without additional constraints from stellar activity. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Tables 2 and 3, and a table of properties derived for the 2111 stars in this study are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/645/A42"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/645/A42{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) have produced of the order of one million light curves at cadences of 120 s and especially 1800 s for every {\textasciitilde}27 day observing sector during its two-year nominal mission. These data constitute a treasure trove for the study of stellar variability and exoplanets. However, to fully utilize the data in such studies a proper removal of systematic-noise sources must be performed before any analysis. The TESS Data for Asteroseismology group is tasked with providing analysis-ready data for the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium, which covers the full spectrum of stellar variability types, including stellar oscillations and pulsations, spanning a wide range of variability timescales and amplitudes. We present here the two current implementations for co-trending of raw photometric light curves from TESS, which cover different regimes of variability to serve the entire seismic community. We find performance in terms of commonly used noise statistics meets expectations and is applicable to a wide range of intrinsic variability types. Further, we find that the correction of light curves from a full sector of data can be completed well within a few days, meaning that when running in steady state our routines are able to process one sector before data from the next arrives. Our pipeline is open-source and all processed data will be made available on the websites of the TESS Asteroseismic Science Operations Center and the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, asteroseismology has increasingly proven to be the observational tool of choice for the study of stellar physics, aided by the high quality of data available from space-based missions such as CoRoT, Kepler, K2, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TESS in particular will produce more than an order of magnitude more such data than has ever been available before. While the standard TESS mission products include light curves from 120 s observations suitable for both exoplanet and asteroseismic studies, they do not include light curves for the vastly larger number of targets observed by the mission at a longer 1800 s cadence in Full Frame Images (FFIs). To address this lack, the TESS Data for Asteroseismology (T'DA) group under the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium (TASC) has constructed an open-source pipeline focused on producing light curves for all stars observed by TESS at all cadences, currently including stars down to a TESS magnitude of 15. The pipeline includes target identification, background estimation and removal, correction of FFI time stamps, and a range of potential photometric extraction methodologies, though aperture photometry is currently the default approach. For the brightest targets, we transparently apply a halo photometry algorithm to construct a calibrated light curve from unsaturated pixels in the image. In this paper, we describe in detail the algorithms, functionality, and products of this pipeline and summarize the noise metrics for the light curves. Companion papers will address the removal of systematic noise sources from our light curves, and a stellar variability classification from these.},

We present objects of particular interest: exceptionally numerous sample of single-mode second-overtone pulsators, five double Cepheids, two Cepheids with eclipsing variations superimposed on the pulsation light curves. At least 139 first-overtone Cepheids exhibit low-amplitude secondary variations with periods in the range 0.60-0.65 of the primary ones. These stars populate three distinct sequences in the Petersen diagram. The origin of this secondary modulation is still unknown. Contrary to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we found only a few candidates for anomalous Cepheids in the SMC. This fact may be a clue for the explanation of the origin of the anomalous Cepheids. The period and luminosity distributions of Cepheids in both Magellanic Clouds suggest that there are two or three populations of classical Cepheids in each of the galaxies. The main difference between the LMC and SMC lays in different numbers of Cepheids in each group. We fit the period-luminosity (PL) relations of SMC Cepheids and compare them with the LMC PL laws.},

These are the largest samples of such types of variable stars detected anywhere outside the Galaxy. We present the period-luminosity and color-magnitude diagrams of stars in the sample. If the boundary period between BL Her and W Vir stars is adopted at 4 days, both groups differ significantly in (V-I) colors. We identify a group of 16 peculiar W Vir stars with different appearance of the light curves, brighter and bluer than ordinary stars of that type. Four of these peculiar W Vir stars show additional eclipsing modulation superimposed on the pulsation light curves. Four other stars of that type show long-period secondary variations which may be ellipsoidal modulations. It suggests that peculiar W Vir subgroup may be related to binarity. In total, we identified seven type II Cepheids simultaneously exhibiting eclipsing variations which is a very large fraction compared to classical Cepheids in the LMC. We discuss diagrams showing Fourier parameters of the light curve decomposition against periods. Three sharp features interpreted as an effect of resonances between radial modes are detectable in these diagrams for type II Cepheids.},

	abstract = {Long-period variable stars arise in the final stages of the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. They have periods of up to about 1,000 days and amplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the I-band flux. These stars pulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode, which is a function of mass and radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of the underlying stellar population. The overall number of long-period variables in a population is directly related to their lifetimes, which is difficult to predict from first principles because of uncertainties associated with stellar mass-loss and convective mixing. The time variability of these stars has not previously been taken into account when modelling the spectral energy distributions of galaxies. Here we construct time-dependent stellar population models that include the effects of long-period variable stars, and report the ubiquitous detection of this expected ‘pixel shimmer’ in the massive metal-rich galaxy M87. The pixel light curves display a variety of behaviours. The observed variation of 0.1 to 1 per cent is very well matched to the predictions of our models. The data provide a strong constraint on the properties of variable stars in an old and metal-rich stellar population, and we infer that the lifetime of long-period variables in M87 is shorter by approximately 30 per cent compared to predictions from the latest stellar evolution models.},

Our sample is those stars that are spectrally typed by Massey and collaborators, including Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-Rayets, and warm and cool supergiants. We use the high-cadence, long-baseline (≍5 yr) data from the iPTF survey, coupled with data-processing tools that model complex features in the light curves. We find widespread photometric (R-band) variability in the upper Hertzsprung Russell diagram (or CMD) with an increasing prevalence of variability with later spectral types. Red stars (V - I {\textgreater} 1.5) exhibit larger amplitude fluctuations than their bluer counterparts. We extract a characteristic variability timescale, tch, via wavelet transformations that are sensitive to both continuous and localized fluctuations. Cool supergiants are characterized by longer timescales ({\textgreater}100 days) than the hotter stars. The latter have typical timescales of tens of days but cover a wider range, from our resolution limit of a few days to longer than 100 days. Using a 60 night block of data straddling two nights with a cadence of around 2 minutes, we extracted tch in the range 0.1-10 days with amplitudes of a few percent for 13 stars. Though there is broad agreement between the observed variability characteristics in the different parts of the upper CMD with theoretical predictions, detailed comparison requires models with a more comprehensive treatment of the various physical processes operating in these stars, such as pulsation, subsurface convection, and the effect of binary companions.},

We use an iterative prewhitening procedure to characterize the short-timescale variability in all eight stars. The periodogram of one of the YSGs, HD 269953, displays multiple strong peaks at higher frequencies than its fellows. While the field surrounding HD 269953 is quite crowded, it is the brightest star in the region, and has infrared colors indicating it is dusty. We suggest HD 269953 may be in a post-red supergiant evolutionary phase. We find a signal with a period of ∼5 days for the LBV HD 269582. The periodogram of S Doradus shows a complicated structure, with peaks below frequencies of 1.5 cycles per day. We fit the shape of the background noise of all eight light curves, and find a red noise component in all of them. However, the power-law slope of the red noise and the timescale over which coherent structures arise changes from star to star. Our results highlight the potential for studying evolved massive stars with TESS.},

	abstract = {Massive stars briefly pass through the yellow supergiant (YSG) phase as they evolve redward across the H-R diagram and expand into red supergiants (RSGs). Higher-mass stars pass through the YSG phase again as they evolve blueward after experiencing significant RSG mass loss. These post-RSG objects offer us a tantalizing glimpse into which stars end their lives as RSGs and why. One telltale sign of a post-RSG object may be an instability to pulsations, depending on the star's interior structure. Here we report the discovery of five YSGs with pulsation periods faster than 1 day, found in a sample of 76 cool supergiants observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite at a two-minute cadence. These pulsating YSGs are concentrated in an H-R diagram region not previously associated with pulsations; we conclude that this is a genuine new class of pulsating star, fast yellow pulsating supergiants (FYPSs). For each FYPS, we extract frequencies via iterative prewhitening and conduct a time-frequency analysis. One FYPS has an extracted frequency that is split into a triplet, and the amplitude of that peak is modulated on the same timescale as the frequency spacing of the triplet; neither rotation nor binary effects are likely culprits. We discuss the evolutionary status of FYPS and conclude that they are candidate post-RSGs. All stars in our sample also show the same stochastic low-frequency variability found in hot OB stars and attributed to internal gravity waves. Finally, we find four α Cygni variables in our sample, of which three are newly discovered.},

The data includes Hubble Space Telescope observations taken in two epochs separated by 3 yr in the F110W and F160W bands. 363 objects (7\% of the sample) exhibit NIR variability at a significant level (Stetson index {\textgreater}1.7), and a higher variability fraction (14\%) is found for the young stellar objects with disk excesses. We identified four high amplitude ({\textgreater}0.6 mag) variables seen in both NIR bands. Follow-up and archival observations of the most variable object in this survey (G286.2032+0.1740) reveal a rising light curve over 8 yr from 2011 to 2019, with a K band brightening of 3.5 mag. Overall the temporal behavior of G286.2032+0.1740 resembles that of typical FU Ori objects; however, its pre-burst luminosity indicates it has a very low mass ({\textless}0.12 M⊙), making it an extreme case of an outburst event that is still ongoing.},

A variety of sampling rates were employed, allowing variability on time scales ranging from {\textasciitilde} 0.3 hours to {\textasciitilde} 20 days to be studied. Among the brightest sources studied, detection of variability as small as sigma {\textasciitilde} 10 mmag is achieved (with \&gt;3sigma confidence); for the typical star observed, sensitivity to variability at levels sigma {\textasciitilde} 20 mmag is achieved. The study is unbiased for stars with 12.5\&lt;B\&lt;18.5, 12.5\&lt;V\&lt;18.5, and 12\&lt;I\&lt;18 within a radius of about 10 arcmin from the cluster centre.

	abstract = {Context. The Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) located in the inner regions of the Milky Way suffer from high extinction that makes their observation challenging. High densities of field stars in their surroundings complicate their study even more. The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey provides a way to explore these GGCs in the near-infrared where extinction effects are highly diminished. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We conduct a search for variable stars in several inner GGCs, taking advantage of the unique multi-epoch, wide-field, near-infrared photometry provided by the VVV survey. We are especially interested in detecting classical pulsators that will help us constrain the physical parameters of these GGCs. In this paper, the second of a series, we focus on NGC 6656 (M 22), NGC 6626 (M 28), NGC 6569, and NGC 6441; these four massive GGCs have known variable sources, but quite different metallicities. We also revisit 2MASS-GC 02 and Terzan 10, the two GGCs studied in the first paper of this series. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We present an improved method and a new parameter that efficiently identify variable candidates in the GGCs. We also use the proper motions of those detected variable candidates and their positions in the sky and in the color-magnitude diagrams to assign membership to the GGCs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We identify and parametrize in the near-infrared numerous variable sources in the studied GGCs, cataloging tens of previously undetected variable stars. We recover many known classical pulsators in these clusters, including the vast majority of their fundamental mode RR Lyrae. We use these pulsators to obtain distances and extinctions toward these objects. Recalibrated period-luminosity-metallicity relations for the RR Lyrae bring the distances to these GGCs to a closer agreement with those reported by Gaia, except for NGC 6441, which is an uncommon Oosterhoff III GGC. Recovered proper motions for these GGCs also agree with those reported by Gaia, except for 2MASS-GC 02, the most reddened GGC in our sample, where the VVV near-infrared measurements provide a more accurate determination of its proper motions. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Lightcurves and full Tables 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/651/A47"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/651/A47{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The analysis of stellar populations has, by and large, been developed for two limiting cases: spatially resolved stellar populations in the color-magnitude diagram, and integrated light observations of distant systems. In between these two extremes lies the semi-resolved regime, which encompasses a rich and relatively unexplored realm of observational phenomena. Here we develop the concept of pixel color-magnitude diagrams (pCMDs) as a powerful technique for analyzing stellar populations in the semi-resolved regime. pCMDs show the distribution of imaging data in the plane of pixel luminosity versus pixel color. A key feature of pCMDs is that they are sensitive to all stars, including both the evolved giants and the unevolved main sequence stars. An important variable in this regime is the mean number of stars per pixel, \{N\}\{\{pix\}\}. Simulated pCMDs demonstrate a strong sensitivity to the star formation history (SFH) and have the potential to break degeneracies between age, metallicity and dust based on two filter data for values of \{N\}\{\{pix\}\} up to at least 104. We extract pCMDs from Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging of M31 and derive SFHs with seven independent age bins from 106 to 1010 year for both the crowded disk and bulge regions (where \{N\}\{\{pix\}\}≈ 30\{--\}\{10\}3). From analyzing a small region of the disk we find a SFH that is smooth and consistent with an exponential decay timescale of 4 Gyr. The bulge SFH is also smooth and consistent with a 2 Gyr decay timescale. pCMDs will likely play an important role in maximizing the science returns from next generation ground and space-based facilities.},

We have used UVOT’s unique wide-field NUV imaging capability to perform the first systematic NUV survey of variable stars in the Galactic globular clusters M3 and M15. We identify 280 variable stars, comprised of 275 RR Lyrae, 2 anomalous Cepheids, 1 classical Cepheid, 1 SX Phoenicis star, and 1 possible long-period or irregular variable. Only two of these are new discoveries. We compare our results to previous investigations and find excellent agreement in the periods with significantly larger amplitudes in the NUV. We map out, for the first time, an NUV Bailey diagram from globular clusters, showing the usual loci for fundamental mode RRab and first overtone RRc pulsators. We show the unique sensitivity of NUV photometry to both the temperatures and the surface gravities of RR Lyrae stars. Finally, we show evidence of an NUV period-metallicity-luminosity relationship. Future investigations will further examine the dependence of NUV pulsation parameters on metallicity and Oosterhoff classification.},

We present an asteroseismic analysis of 493 M giants using data from two ground-based surveys: the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). By comparing the extracted frequencies with constraints from Kepler, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment, and Gaia we demonstrate that ground-based transient surveys allow accurate distance measurements to oscillating M giants with a precision of ∼15\%. Using stellar population synthesis models we predict that ATLAS and ASAS-SN can provide asteroseismic distances to ∼2 × 106 galactic M giants out to typical distances of 20-50 kpc, vastly improving the reach of Gaia and providing critical constraints for Galactic archeology and galactic dynamics.},

It relies on identifying sequences of pulsation modes that can be compared with theoretical models, which has been done successfully for many classes of pulsators, including low-mass solar-type stars2, red giants3, high-mass stars4 and white dwarfs5. However, a large group of pulsating stars of intermediate mass—the so-called δ Scuti stars—have rich pulsation spectra for which systematic mode identification has not hitherto been possible6,7. This arises because only a seemingly random subset of possible modes are excited and because rapid rotation tends to spoil regular patterns8-10. Here we report the detection of remarkably regular sequences of high-frequency pulsation modes in 60 intermediate-mass main-sequence stars, which enables definitive mode identification. The space motions of some of these stars indicate that they are members of known associations of young stars, as confirmed by modelling of their pulsation spectra.},

	abstract = {Studies of the ages, abundances, and motions of individual stars in the Milky Way provide one of the best ways to study the evolution of disc galaxies over cosmic time. The formation of the Milky Way's barred inner region in particular is a crucial piece of the puzzle of disc galaxy evolution. Using data from APOGEE and Gaia, we present maps of the kinematics, elemental abundances, and age of the Milky Way bulge and disc that show the barred structure of the inner Milky Way in unprecedented detail. The kinematic maps allow a direct, purely kinematic determination of the bar's pattern speed of 41± 3 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} kpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} and of its shape and radial profile. We find the bar's age, metallicity, and abundance ratios to be the same as those of the oldest stars in the disc that are formed in its turbulent beginnings, while stars in the bulge outside of the bar are younger and more metal-rich. This implies that the bar likely formed \{≈\}8 Gyr ago, when the decrease in turbulence in the gas disc allowed a thin disc to form that quickly became bar-unstable. The bar's formation therefore stands as a crucial epoch in the evolution of the Milky Way, a picture that is in line with the evolutionary path that emerges from observations of the gas kinematics in external disc galaxies over the last \{≈\}10 Gyr.},

	abstract = {We present stellar age distributions of the Milky Way bulge region using ages for ∼6000 high-luminosity ( \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(g) 2.0\$ ), metal-rich ([Fe/H] ≥ -0.5) bulge stars observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. Ages are derived using The Cannon label-transfer method, trained on a sample of nearby luminous giants with precise parallaxes for which we obtain ages using a Bayesian isochrone-matching technique. We find that the metal-rich bulge is predominantly composed of old stars ({\textgreater}8 Gyr). We find evidence that the planar region of the bulge ( \${\textbar} \{Z\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GC\}\}{\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqslant 0.25\$ kpc) is enriched in metallicity, Z, at a faster rate (dZ/dt ∼ 0.0034 Gyr-1) than regions farther from the plane (dZ/dt ∼ 0.0013 Gyr-1 at \${\textbar} \{Z\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GC\}\}{\textbar} 1.00\$ kpc). We identify a nonnegligible fraction of younger stars (age ∼2-5 Gyr) at metallicities of +0.2 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} +0.4. These stars are preferentially found in the plane ( \${\textbar} \{Z\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GC\}\}{\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqslant 0.25\$ kpc) and at Rcy ≍ 2-3 kpc, with kinematics that are more consistent with rotation than are the kinematics of older stars at the same metallicities. We do not measure a significant age difference between stars found inside and outside the bar. These findings show that the bulge experienced an initial starburst that was more intense close to the plane than far from the plane. Then, star formation continued at supersolar metallicities in a thin disk at 2 kpc ≲ Rcy ≲ 3 kpc until ∼2 Gyr ago.},

	abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open-source software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates “on-the-fly” from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.},

	abstract = {In this work, we aim at constraining the age of the young open cluster Melotte 20, known as α Per, using seismic indices. The method consists of the following steps: (1) Extract the frequency content of a sample of stars in the field of an open cluster. (2) Search for possible regularities in the frequency spectra of δ Sct stars candidates, using different techniques, such as the Fourier transform, the autocorrelation function, the histogram of frequency differences and the échelle diagram. (3) Constrain the age of the selected stars by both the physical parameters and seismic indices by comparing them with a grid of asteroseismic models representative of δ Sct stars. (4) Find possible common ages between these stars to determine the age of the cluster. We performed the pulsation analysis with MULTIMODES, a rapid, accurate and powerful open-source code, which is presented in this paper. The result is that the age of α Per could be between 96 and 100 Myr. This is an improvement over different techniques in the past. We therefore show that space astroseismology is capable of taking important steps in the dating of young open clusters.},

	abstract = {Context. Observations of massive stars in open clusters younger than ∼8 Myr have shown that a majority of them are in binary systems, most of which will interact during their life. While these can be used as a proxy of the initial multiplicity properties, studying populations of massive stars older than ∼20 Myr allows us to probe the outcome of these interactions after a significant number of systems have experienced mass and angular momentum transfer and may even have merged. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Using multi-epoch integral-field spectroscopy, we aim to investigate the multiplicity properties of the massive-star population in the dense core of the ∼40 Myr old cluster NGC 330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud in order to search for possible imprints of stellar evolution on the multiplicity properties. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We obtained six epochs of VLT/MUSE observations operated in wide-field mode with the extended wavelength setup and supported by adaptive optics. We extracted spectra and measured radial velocities for stars brighter than m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}F814W{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 19. We identified single-lined spectroscopic binaries through significant RV variability with a peak-to-peak amplitude larger than 20 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We also identified double-lined spectroscopic binaries, and quantified the observational biases for binary detection. In particular, we took into account that binary systems with similar line strengths are difficult to detect in our data set. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The observed spectroscopic binary fraction among stars brighter than m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}F814W{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 19 (approximately 5.5 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} on the main sequence) is f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}SB{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} = 13.2 ± 2.0\%. Considering period and mass ratio ranges from log(P) = 0.15−3.5 (about 1.4 to 3160 d), q = 0.1−1.0, and a representative set of orbital parameter distributions, we find a bias-corrected close binary fraction of f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}cl{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 34{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}−7{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\%. This fraction seems to decline for the fainter stars, which indicates either that the close binary fraction drops in the B-type domain, or that the period distribution becomes more heavily weighted toward longer orbital periods. We further find that both fractions vary strongly in different regions of the color-magnitude diagram, which corresponds to different evolutionary stages. This probably reveals the imprint of the binary history of different groups of stars. In particular, we find that the observed spectroscopic binary fraction of Be stars (f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}SB{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} = 2 ± 2\%) is significantly lower than that of B-type stars (f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}SB{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} = 9 ± 2\%). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We provide the first homogeneous radial velocity study of a large sample of B-type stars at a low metallicity ([Fe/H] ≲ −1.0). The overall bias-corrected close binary fraction (log(P) \&lt; 3.5 d) of the B-star population in NGC 330 is lower than the fraction reported for younger Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud clusters in previous works.

The coordinates and light curve properties, such as period and Oosterhoff type, are made publicly available. We analyze in detail the light curve properties and Galactic distribution of the subset of {\textasciitilde}4000 type ab RR Lyrae (RRab) stars, including a search for new halo substructures and the number density distribution as a function of Oosterhoff type. We find evidence for the Oosterhoff dichotomy among field RR Lyrae stars, with the ratio of the type II and I subsamples of about 1:4, but with a weaker separation than for globular cluster stars. The wide sky coverage and depth of this sample allow unique constraints for the number density distribution of halo RRab stars as a function of galactocentric distance: it can be described as an oblate ellipsoid with an axis ratio q = 0.63 and with either a single or a double power law with a power-law index in the range -2 to -3. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the Oosterhoff type II subsample has a steeper number density profile than the Oosterhoff type I subsample. Using the group-finding algorithm EnLink, we detected seven candidate halo groups, only one of which is statistically spurious. Three of these groups are near globular clusters (M53/NGC 5053, M3, M13), and one is near a known halo substructure (Virgo Stellar Stream); the remaining three groups do not seem to be near any known halo substructures or globular clusters and seem to have a higher ratio of Oosterhoff type II to Oosterhoff type I RRab stars than what is found in the halo. The extended morphology and the position (outside the tidal radius) of some of the groups near globular clusters are suggestive of tidal streams possibly originating from globular clusters. Spectroscopic follow-up of detected halo groups is encouraged.},

A significant number of transiting exoplanets have now been discovered for which the mass, radius, semi-major axis, host star metallicity and stellar effective temperature are known. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We use multivariate regression models to determine the power-law dependence of planetary radius on planetary equilibrium temperature T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eq{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, planetary mass M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, stellar metallicity [Fe/H], orbital semi-major axis a, and tidal heating rate H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}tidal{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, for 119 transiting planets in three distinct mass regimes. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We fit models initially to all 119 planets, resulting in fairly high scatter between fitted and observed radii, and subsequently to three subsets of these planets: Saturn-mass planets, Jupiter-mass planets, and high-mass planets. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find models for each subset that fit the observed planetary radii well and show the importance of the various environmental parameters on each subset. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We determine that heating leads to larger planet radii, as expected, increasing mass leads to increased or decreased radii of low-mass (\&lt;0.5 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) and high-mass (\&gt;2.0 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) planets, respectively (with no mass effect on Jupiter-mass planets), and increased host-star metallicity leads to smaller planetary radii, indicating a relationship between host-star metallicity and planet heavy element content. For Saturn-mass planets, a good fit to the radii may be obtained from log(R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = -0.077 + 0.450 log(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) - 0.314 [Fe/H] + 0.671 log(a/AU) + 0.398 log(T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eq{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/K). The radii of Jupiter-mass planets may be fit by log(R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = - 2.217 + 0.856 log(T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eq{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/K) + 0.291 log(a/AU). High-mass planets' radii are best fit by log(R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = -1.067 + 0.380 log(T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eq{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/K) - 0.093 log(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) - 0.057 [Fe/H] + 0.019 log(H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}tidal{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/1 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}20{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). These equations produce a very good fit to the observed radii, with a mean absolute difference between fitted and observed radius of 0.11 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, compared to the mean reported uncertainty in observed radius of 0.07 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. A clear distinction is seen between the core-dominated Saturn-mass (0.1-0.5 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) planets, whose radii are determined almost exclusively by their mass and heavy element content, and the gaseous envelope-dominated Jupiter-mass (0.5-2.0 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) planets, whose radii increase strongly with irradiating flux, partially offset by a power-law dependence on orbital separation.},

	abstract = {Literature on optical and infrared microvariability in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reflects a diversity of statistical tests and strategies to detect tiny variations in the light curves of these sources. Comparison between the results obtained using different methodologies is difficult, and the pros and cons of each statistical method are often badly understood or even ignored. Even worse, improperly tested methodologies are becoming more and more common, and biased results may be misleading with regard to the origin of the AGN microvariability. This paper intends to point future research on AGN microvariability toward the use of powerful and well-tested statistical methodologies, providing a reference for choosing the best strategy to obtain unbiased results. Light curves monitoring has been simulated for quasars and for reference and comparison stars. Changes for the quasar light curves include both Gaussian fluctuations and linear variations. Simulated light curves have been analyzed using χ2 tests, F tests for variances, one-way analyses of variance and C-statistics. Statistical Type I and Type II errors, which indicate the robustness and the power of the tests, have been obtained in each case. One-way analyses of variance and χ2 prove to be powerful and robust estimators for microvariations, while the C-statistic is not a reliable methodology and its use should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Variability is a property shared by practically all active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This makes variability selection a possible technique for identifying AGNs. Given that variability selection makes no prior assumption about spectral properties, it is a powerful technique for detecting both low-luminosity AGNs in which the host galaxy emission is dominating and AGNs with unusual spectral properties. In this paper, we will discuss and test different statistical methods for the detection of variability in sparsely sampled data that allow full control over the false positive rates. We will apply these methods to the GOODS North and South fields and present a catalog of variable sources in the z band in both GOODS fields. Out of the 11,931 objects checked, we find 155 variable sources at a significance level of 99.9\%, corresponding to about 1.3\% of all objects. After rejection of stars and supernovae, 139 variability-selected AGNs remain. Their magnitudes reach down as faint as 25.5 mag in z. Spectroscopic redshifts are available for 22 of the variability-selected AGNs, ranging from 0.046 to 3.7. The absolute magnitudes in the rest-frame z band range from {\textasciitilde}-18 to -24, reaching substantially fainter than the typical luminosities probed by traditional X-ray and spectroscopic AGN selection in these fields. Therefore, this is a powerful technique for future exploration of the evolution of the faint end of the AGN luminosity function up to high redshifts. Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},

	abstract = {The δ Sct stars are a diverse group of intermediate-mass pulsating stars located on and near the main sequence within the classical instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Many of these stars are hybrid stars pulsating simultaneously with pressure and gravity modes that probe the physics at different depths within a star's interior. Using two large ensembles of δ Sct stars observed by the Kepler Space Telescope, the instrumental biases inherent to Kepler mission data and the statistical properties of these stars are investigated. An important focus of this work is an analysis of the relationships between the pulsational and stellar parameters, and their distribution within the classical instability strip. It is found that a non-negligible fraction of main-sequence δ Sct stars exist outside theoretical predictions of the classical instability boundaries, which indicates the necessity of a mass-dependent mixing length parameter to simultaneously explain low and high radial order pressure modes in δ Sct stars within the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Furthermore, a search for regularities in the amplitude spectra of these stars is also presented, specifically the frequency difference between pressure modes of consecutive radial order. In this work, it is demonstrated that an ensemble-based approach using space photometry from the Kepler mission is not only plausible for δ Sct stars, but that it is a valuable method for identifying the most promising stars for mode identification and asteroseismic modelling. The full scientific potential of studying δ Sct stars is as yet unrealized. The ensembles discussed in this paper represent a high-quality data set for future studies of rotation and angular momentum transport inside A and F stars using asteroseismology.},

Using an empirical relation and a 2D autocorrelation method, we determine the large frequency separation for targets.

	abstract = {We review the use of young low mass stars and protostars, or young stellar objects (YSOs), as tracers of star formation. Observations of molecular clouds at visible, infrared, radio and X-ray wavelengths can identify and characterize the YSOs populating these clouds, with the ability to detect deeply embedded objects at all evolutionary stages. Surveys with the Spitzer, Herschel, XMM-Newton and Chandra space telescopes have measured the spatial distribution of YSOs within a number of nearby ({\textless}2.5 kpc) molecular clouds, showing surface densities varying by more than three orders of magnitude. These surveys have been used to measure the spatially varying star formation rates and efficiencies within clouds, and when combined with maps of the molecular gas, have led to the discovery of star-forming relations within clouds. YSO surveys can also characterize the structures, ages, and star formation histories of embedded clusters, and they illuminate the relationship of the clusters to the networks of filaments, hubs and ridges in the molecular clouds from which they form. Measurements of the proper motions and radial velocities of YSOs trace the evolving kinematics of clusters from the deeply embedded phases through gas dispersal, providing insights into the factors that shape the formation of bound clusters. On 100 pc scales that encompass entire star-forming complexes, Gaia is mapping the young associations of stars that have dispersed their natal gas and exist alongside molecular clouds. These surveys reveal the complex structures and motions in associations, and show evidence for supernova driven expansions. Remnants of these associations have now been identified by Gaia, showing that traces of star-forming structures can persist for a few hundred million years.},

	abstract = {Our former study on the empirical relations between the Fourier parameters of the light curves of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars and their basic stellar parameters has been extended to considerably larger data sets. The most significant contribution to the absolute magnitude M\_v comes from the period P and from the first Fourier amplitude A\_1, but there are statistically significant contributions also from additional higher order components, most importantly from A\_3 and in a lesser degree from the Fourier phase phi\_51. When different colors are combined in reddening-free quantities, we obtain basically period-luminosity-color relations. Due to the log T\_eff (B-V, log g, [Fe/H]) relation from stellar atmosphere models, we would expect some dependence also on phi\_31. Unfortunately, the data are still not extensive and accurate enough to decipher clearly the small effect of this Fourier phase. However, with the aid of more accurate multicolor data on field variables, we show that this Fourier phase should be present either in V-I or in B-V or in both. From the standard deviations of the various regressions, an upper limit can be obtained on the overall inhomogeneity of the reddening in the individual clusters. This yields sigma\_E(B-V)\vphantom{\{}\}{\textless} 0.012 mag, which also implies an average minimum observational error of sigma\_V {\textgreater} 0.018 mag.},

This vast amount of data contains a wealth of information for variability, exoplanet, and stellar astrophysics studies but requires a number of processing steps before it can be fully utilized. In order to efficiently process all the TESS data and make it available to the wider scientific community, the TESS Data for Asteroseismology working group, as part of the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium, has created an automated open-source processing pipeline to produce light curves corrected for systematics from the short- and long-cadence raw photometry data and to classify these according to stellar variability type. We will process all stars down to a TESS magnitude of 15. This paper is the next in a series detailing how the pipeline works. Here, we present our methodology for the automatic variability classification of TESS photometry using an ensemble of supervised learners that are combined into a metaclassifier. We successfully validate our method using a carefully constructed labelled sample of Kepler Q9 light curves with a 27.4 days time span mimicking single-sector TESS observations, on which we obtain an overall accuracy of 94.9\%. We demonstrate that our methodology can successfully classify stars outside of our labeled sample by applying it to all \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 167,000 stars observed in Q9 of the Kepler space mission.},

We derive the most reliable parameters for this cluster using all the available photometric, spectroscopic and proper motion data. The interstellar extinction over the cluster area is uniform and normal with E(B-V)=0.51 +/- 0.03 mag. We determine a distance of 3.3 +/- 0.23 Kpc to the cluster. The theoretical isochrone fittings to the Cepheid variables as well as the evolved part of the main-sequence near turn-off point indicate that the cluster is 120 +/- 20 Myr old. We estimate the cluster radius to be 3farcm 7 using radial stellar density profile. Both the distance and age determined using period luminosity/age relations for the Cepheid variables are consistent with their membership of the cluster. This unique opportunity has therefore been used to refine the zero-point of the period-luminosity relation for the Galactic Cepheids.

	abstract = {The Carnegie Hubble Program (CHP) is designed to calibrate the extragalactic distance scale using data from the post-cryogenic era of the Spitzer Space Telescope. The ultimate goal of the CHP is a systematic improvement in the distance scale leading to a determination of the Hubble constant to within an accuracy of 2\%. This paper focuses on the measurement and calibration of the Galactic Cepheid period-luminosity (PL, Leavitt) relation using the warm Spitzer/IRAC 1 and 2 bands at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. We present photometric measurements covering the period range 4-70 days for 37 Galactic Cepheids. Data at 24 phase points were collected for each star. Three PL relations of the form M = a(log (P) - 1) + b are derived. The method adopted here takes the slope a to be -3.31, as determined from the Spitzer Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) data of Scowcroft et al. Using the geometric Hubble Space Telescope guide-star distances to 10 Galactic Cepheids, we find a calibrated 3.6 μm PL zero point of -5.80 ± 0.03. Together with our value for the LMC zero point, we determine a reddening-corrected distance modulus of 18.48 ± 0.04 mag to the LMC. The mid-IR period-color diagram and the [3.6]-[4.5] color variation with phase are interpreted in terms of CO absorption at 4.5 μm. This situation compromises the use of the 4.5 μm data for distance determinations.},

An automatic isochrone fitting scheme is applied to all cluster candidates. With a combination of parameters obtained from isochrone fitting, we classify cluster candidates into three classes (Class 1, 2, and 3). Class 1 clusters are the most probable star cluster candidates with the most stringent criteria. Most of these clusters are nearby (within 4 kpc). Our catalog is crossmatched with three Galactic star cluster catalogs, Kharchenko et al., Gaudin et al., and Bica et al. The proper motion and parallax of matched star clusters are in good agreement with these earlier catalogs. We discover 76 new star cluster candidates that are not listed in these three catalogs. The majority of these are clusters older than log(age/yr) = 8.0 and are located in the inner disk with {\textbar} b{\textbar} {\textless} 5{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ . The recent discovery of new star clusters suggests that current Galactic star cluster catalogs are still incomplete.

	abstract = {Context. Many of the open clusters listed in modern catalogues were initially reported by visual astronomers as apparent overdensities of bright stars. As observational techniques and analysis methods continue to improve, some of them have been shown to be chance alignments of stars and not true clusters. Recent publications making use of Gaia DR2 data have provided membership lists for over a thousand clusters, however, many nearby objects listed in the literature have so far evaded detection. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to update the Gaia DR2 cluster census by performing membership determinations for known clusters that had been missed by previous studies and for recently-discovered clusters. We investigate a sub-set of non-detected clusters that, according to their literature parameters, should be easily visible in Gaia. Confirming or disproving the existence of old, inner-disc, high-altitude clusters is especially important as their survival or disruption is linked to the dynamical processes that drive the evolution of the Milky Way. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We employed the Gaia DR2 catalogue and a membership assignment procedure, as well as visual inspections of spatial, proper motion, and parallax distributions. We used membership lists provided by other authors when available. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We derived membership lists for 150 objects, including ten that were already known prior to Gaia. We compiled a final list of members for 1481 clusters. Among the objects that we are still unable to identify with the Gaia data, we argue that many (mostly putatively old, relatively nearby, high-altitude objects) are not true clusters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: At present, the only confirmed cluster located further than 500 pc away from the Galactic plane within the Solar circle is NGC 6791. It is likely that the objects discussed in this study only represent a fraction of the non-physical groupings erroneously listed in the catalogues as genuine open clusters and that those lists need further cleaning. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Table 1 and the list of individual members are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/633/A99"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/633/A99{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

This multi-band catalog was constructed over 20 years, starting with visual inspections on the Digital Sky Survey and incremented with the 2MASS, WISE, VVV, Spitzer, and Herschel surveys. Large and small catalogs, as well as papers on individual objects have been systematically cross-identified. The catalog provides Galactic and equatorial coordinates, angular diameters, and chronologically ordered designations, making it simple to assign discoveries and verify how often the objects were cataloged by different authors, search methods, and/or surveys. Detection in a single band is the minimum constraint to validate an entry. About 3200 objects have measured parameters in the literature. A fundamental contribution of the present study is to present an additional ≈7700 objects for the first analyses of nature, photometry, spectroscopy and structure. The present focus is not to compile or determine fundamental parameters, but to provide a catalog uniformly characterizing the entries. A major result is that now 4234 embedded clusters are cataloged, a factor of ≈1.5 larger than open clusters. In addition to cross-identifications in different references and wavelength domains, we also communicate the discovery of 638 star clusters and similar objects. The present general catalog provides previously studied objects and thousands of additional entries in a homogeneous way, a timely contribution to Gaia-related works.},

	abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will observe ∼150 million stars brighter than \{T\vphantom{\{}\}mag\}≈ 16, with photometric precision from 60 ppm to 3\%, enabling an array of exoplanet and stellar astrophysics investigations. While light curves will be provided for ∼400,000 targets observed at 2 minute cadence, observations of most stars will only be provided as full-frame images (FFIs) at 30 minute cadence. The TESS image scale of ∼21″/pix is highly susceptible to crowding, blending, and source confusion, and the highly spatially variable point-spread function (PSF) will challenge traditional techniques, such as aperture and Gaussian-kernel PSF photometry. We use official “End-to-End 6” TESS simulated FFIs to demonstrate a difference image analysis pipeline, using a δ-function kernel, that achieves the mission specification noise floor of 60 ppm hr-1/2. We show that the pipeline performance does not depend on position across the field, and only ∼2\% of stars appear to exhibit residual systematics at the level of ∼5 ppt. We also demonstrate recoverability of planet transits, eclipsing binaries, and other variables. We provide the pipeline as an open-source tool at https://github.com/ryanoelkers/DIA in both IDL and PYTHON. We intend to extract light curves for all point sources in the TESS FFIs as soon as they become publicly available, and will provide the light curves through the Filtergraph data visualization service. An example data portal based on the simulated FFIs is available for inspection at https://filtergraph.com/tess\_ffi.},

	abstract = {Young associations in star-forming regions are stellar systems that allow us to understand the mechanisms that characterize the stars in their early life and what happens around them. In particular, the analysis of the discs and of the exoplanets around young stars allows us to know the key processes that prevail in their evolution and understand the properties of the exoplanets orbiting older stars. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission is giving us the opportunity to extract and analyse the light curves of association members with high accuracy, but the crowding that affects these regions makes difficult the light curve extraction. In the PATHOS project, cutting-edge tools are used to extract high-precision light curves and identify variable stars and transiting exoplanets in open clusters and associations. In this work, I analysed the light curves of stars in five young (≲10 Myr) associations, searching for variables and candidate exoplanets. Using the rotational periods of the association members, I constrained the ages of the five stellar systems ({\textasciitilde}2-10 Myr). I searched for dippers, and I investigated the properties of the dust that forms the circumstellar discs. Finally, I searched for transiting signals, finding six strong candidate exoplanets. No candidates with radius RP ≲ 0.9 RJ have been detected, in agreement with the expectations. The frequency of giant planets resulted to be {\textasciitilde}2-3 per cent, higher than that expected for field stars (≲ 1 per cent); the low statistic makes this conclusion not strong, and new investigations on young objects are mandatory to confirm this result.},

	abstract = {The scope of the project 'A PSF-based Approach to TESS High Quality data Of Stellar clusters' (PATHOS) is the extraction and analysis of high-precision light curves of stars in stellar clusters and young associations for the identification of candidate exoplanets and variable stars. The cutting-edge tools used in this project allow us to measure the real flux of stars in dense fields, minimizing the effects due to contamination by neighbour sources. We extracted about 200 000 light curves of stars in 645 open clusters located in the Southern ecliptic hemisphere and observed by TESS during the first year of its mission. We searched for transiting signals and we found 33 objects of interest, 11 of which are strong candidate exoplanets. Because of the limited SNR, we did not find any Earth or super-Earth. We identified two Neptune-size planets orbiting stars with \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}star \} 1.5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}it R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , implying a frequency \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}=1.34 {\textbackslash}pm 0.95{\textbackslash}, \{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ , consistent with the frequency around field stars. The seven Jupiter candidates around stars with \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}star \} {\textbackslash}, 1.5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}it R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ imply a frequency \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}=0.19{\textbackslash}pm 0.07{\textbackslash}, \{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ , which is smaller than in the field. A more complete estimate of the survey completeness and false positive rate is needed to confirm these results. Light curves used in this work will be made available to the astronomical community on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescope under the project PATHOS.},

Here we present the first application of asteroseismology to the problem of stellar obliquity determination in systems with transiting planets and Sun-like host stars. We consider two systems observed by the NASA Kepler mission which have multiple transiting small (super-Earth sized) planets: the previously reported Kepler-50 and a new system, Kepler-65, whose planets we validate in this paper. Both stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations. From the asteroseismic analysis we find that each host has its rotation axis nearly perpendicular to the line of sight with the sines of the angles constrained at the 1σ level to lie above 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. We use statistical arguments to show that coplanar orbits are favored in both systems, and that the orientations of the planetary orbits and the stellar rotation axis are correlated.},

	abstract = {We present a catalog of stellar properties for a large sample of 6676 evolved stars with Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment spectroscopic parameters and Kepler asteroseismic data analyzed using five independent techniques. Our data include evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them. We employ a new empirical approach for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing (Δν) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero-point of the frequency of the maximum power (ν max) relation to be consistent with masses and radii for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines are in much better agreement than would be expected from the pipeline-predicted random errors, but 22\% of them had at least one method not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators is consistent with our error model, which yields median random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\%. Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\% level, respectively, for red clump stars.},

Parallax uncertainties are in the range of up to 0.04 milliarcsecond for sources at G{\textless}15, around 0.1mas for sources with G=17 and at the faint end, the uncertainty is of the order of 0.7mas at G=20. The corresponding uncertainties in the respective proper motion components are up to 0.06mas/yr (for G{\textless}15mag), 0.2mas/yr (for G=17mag) and 1.2mas/yr (for G=20mag). The Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motions are based only on Gaia data; they do no longer depend on the Tycho-2 Catalogue. Median radial velocities (i.e. the median value over the epochs) for more than 6 million stars with a mean G magnitude between about 4 and 13 and an effective temperature (Teff) in the range of about 3550 to 6900K. This leads to a full six-parameter solution: positions and motions on the sky with parallaxes and radial velocities, all combined with mean G magnitudes. The overall precision of the radial velocities at the bright end is in the order of 200-300m/s while at the faint end the overall precision is approximately 1.2km/s for a Teff of 4750K and about 2.5km/s for a Teff of 6500K. An additional set of more than 200 million sources for which a two-parameter solution is available: the positions on the sky (alpha,delta) combined with the mean G magnitude. These sources will have a positional uncertainty at G=20 of about 2mas, at J2015.5. G magnitudes for more than 1.5 billion sources, with precisions varying from around 1 milli-mag at the bright (G{\textless}13) end to around 20 milli-mag at G=20.

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}{\textless}A href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia"{\textgreater}http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art photometric measurements of extragalactic Cepheids account for the mean additional light due to chance superposition of Cepheids on crowded backgrounds through the use of artificial star measurements. However, light from stars physically associated with Cepheids may bias relative distance measurements if the changing spatial resolution along the distance ladder significantly alters the amount of associated blending. We have identified two regimes where this phenomenon may occur: Cepheids in wide binaries and in open clusters. We estimate stellar association bias using the photometric passbands and reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes used to set up the distance scale. For wide binaries, we rely on Geneva stellar evolution models in conjunction with detailed statistics on intermediate-mass binary stars. For the impact of cluster stars, we have compiled information on the clustered Cepheid fraction and measured the typical cluster contribution in M31 via deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging provided by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury project. We find that the dominant effect on the distance scale comes from Cepheids in clusters, even though cluster Cepheids are a relatively rare phenomenon. Wide binaries have a negligible effect of 0.004\% on H 0 for long-period Cepheids observed in the near-infrared or when considering Wesenheit magnitudes. We estimate that blending due to cluster populations has previously resulted in a 0.23\% overestimate of H 0. Correcting for this bias, we obtain \{H\}0=73.07 +/- 1.76 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1 \{Mpc\vphantom{\{}\}\}-1, which remains in 3.3σ tension with the Planck value. We conclude that stellar association bias does not constitute a limit for measuring H 0 with an accuracy of 1\%.},

	abstract = {More than a century ago, Henrietta Leavitt discovered the first Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds together with the famous period-luminosity relationship revealed by these stars, which soon after revolutionized our view of the Universe. Over the years, the number of known Cepheids in these galaxies has steadily increased with the breakthrough in the last two decades thanks to the new generation of large-scale long-term sky variability surveys. Here we present the final upgrade of the OGLE Collection of Cepheids in the Magellanic System which already contained the vast majority of known Cepheids. The updated collection now comprises 9649 classical and 262 anomalous Cepheids. Type-II Cepheids will be updated shortly. Thanks to high completeness of the OGLE survey the sample of classical Cepheids includes virtually all stars of this type in the Magellanic Clouds. Thus, the OGLE survey concludes the work started by Henrietta Leavitt. Additionally, the OGLE sample of RR Lyr stars in the Magellanic System has been updated. It now counts 46 443 variables.

The Gaia DR2 catalogue for RR Lyrae stars (Clementini et al. 2018) is used along with the proper motions and tidal radii data for the globular clusters compiled from literature. A sample of 56 Galactic globular clusters is analysed. Out of these 56 Galactic globular clusters, only 11 have extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars. However, only two clusters, namely, NGC 3201 and NGC 5024, have enough extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars to draw interesting conclusions. NGC 3201 has 13 extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars which are asymmetrically distributed around its centre with more number of stars in its trailing zone than its leading part. We conclude that these asymmetrical tidal tails are due to the combined effect of tidal disruption and the stripped debris from the cluster. On the other hand, NGC 5024 has five extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars, four of them are concentrated in a region which is at a distance of about three times the tidal radius from its centre. These may be the stars that are being ripped apart from the cluster due to tidal disruption. The presence of these extra-tidal RR Lyrae stars in the clusters can be an indication that more cluster stars are present outside their tidal radii which may be revealed by deep wide field colour-magnitude diagrams of the clusters.},

This novel approach allows us to bypass the systematics on the GDR2 Cepheids parallaxes that is induced by saturation and variability. We adopt a GDR2 parallax zero-point (ZP) of -0.046 mas with an uncertainty of 0.015 mas that covers most of the recent estimates. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We present new Galactic calibrations of the Leavitt law in the V, J, H, K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}S{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and Wesenheit W{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}H{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} bands.

The multiplicity of classical Cepheids (CCs) and RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) is still imperfectly known, particularly for RRLs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In order to complement the close-in short orbital period systems presented in Paper I, our aim is to detect the wide, spatially resolved companions of the targets of our reference samples of Galactic CCs and RRLs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Angularly resolved common proper motion pairs were detected using a simple progressive selection algorithm to separate the most probable candidate companions from the unrelated field stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We found 27 resolved, high probability gravitationally bound systems with CCs out of 456 examined stars, and one unbound star embedded in the circumstellar dusty nebula of the long-period Cepheid RS Pup. We found seven spatially resolved, probably bound systems with RRL primaries out of 789 investigated stars, and 22 additional candidate pairs. We report in particular new companions of three bright RRLs: OV And (companion of F4V spectral type), RR Leo (M0V), and SS Oct (K2V). In addition, we discovered resolved companions of 14 stars that were likely misclassified as RRLs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The detection of resolved non-variable companions around CCs and RRLs facilitates the validation of their Gaia DR2 parallaxes.

We perform an eight-dimensional all-sky census that aims to identify new bona fide CCs and provides a ranking of membership confidence for known CC candidates according to membership probabilities. The probabilities are computed for combinations of known Galactic open clusters and classical Cepheid candidates, based on spatial, kinematic and population-specific membership constraints. Data employed in this analysis are taken largely from published literature and supplemented by a year-round observing programme on both hemispheres dedicated to determining systemic radial velocities of Cepheids. In total, we find 23 bona fide CCs, 5 of which are candidates identified for the first time, including an overtone-Cepheid member in NGC 129. We discuss a subset of CC candidates in detail, some of which have been previously mentioned in the literature. Our results indicate unlikely membership for seven Cepheids that have been previously discussed in terms of cluster membership. We furthermore revisit the Galactic PLR using our bona fide CC sample and obtain a result consistent with the recent calibration by Turner. However, our calibration remains limited mainly by cluster uncertainties and the small number of long-period calibrators. In the near future, Gaia will enable our study to be carried out in much greater detail and accuracy, thanks to data homogeneity and greater levels of completeness.},

	abstract = {We investigated the occurrence of classical (type-I) Cepheid variable stars (henceforth Cepheids) in dynamically evolving star clusters from birth to an age of approximately 300 Myr. The clusters are modelled by the Aarseth code NBODY6, and they feature a realistic stellar initial mass function and initial binary star population, single star and binary star evolution, expulsion of the primordial gas, and tidal field of the galaxy. Our simulations provide the first detailed dynamical picture of how frequently Cepheids remain gravitationally bound to their birth clusters versus how frequently they occur in the field. They allow us to quantify the relevance of various cluster ejection mechanisms and how they depend on stellar mass. Overall, the simulations agree with the empirical picture that a small fraction (≈10\%) of Cepheids reside in clusters, that cluster halo membership is relatively common, and that the majority of Cepheid hosting clusters only have a single Cepheid member. Additionally, the simulations predict that (a) Cepheid progenitors are much more likely to escape from low-mass than higher mass clusters; (b) higher-mass (long-period) Cepheids are ≈30\% more likely to be found in clusters than low-mass (short-period) Cepheids; (c) the clustered Cepheid fraction increases with galactocentric radius since cluster dispersal is less efficient at greater radii; (d) a lower metallicity reduces the overall clustered Cepheid fraction because the lower minimum mass of Cepheids leaves more time for cluster dispersal (this primarily affects short-period Cepheids); and (e) high-mass clusters are much more likely to have more than one Cepheid member at any given time, in particular at a lower metallicity. We interpret the results as outcomes of various aspects of star cluster dynamics.

In this work, we look for candidate AGB stars in M31 star clusters from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey. Our photometric criteria selects stars brighter than the tip of the red giant branch, which includes the bulk of the thermally pulsing AGB stars as well as early-AGB stars and other luminous cool giants expected in young stellar populations (e.g., massive red supergiants, and intermediate-mass red helium-burning stars). The AGB stars can be differentiated, a posteriori, using the ages already estimated for our cluster sample. 937 candidates are found within the cluster aperture radii, half (∼450) of which are very likely cluster members. Cross-matching with additional databases reveals two carbon stars and 10 secure variables among them. The field-corrected age distribution reveals the presence of young supergiants peaking at ages smaller than 108 yr, followed by a long tail of AGB stars extending up to the oldest possible ages. This long tail reveals the general decrease in the numbers of AGB stars from initial values of \${\textbackslash}sim 50{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at 108 yr down to \${\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at 1010 yr. Theoretical models of near-solar metallicity reproduce this general trend, although with localized discrepancies over some age intervals, whose origin is not yet identified.

During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets.

	abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has an exceptionally large plate scale of 21"/px, causing most TESS light curves to record the blended light of multiple stars. This creates a danger of misattributing variability observed by TESS to the wrong source, which would invalidate any analysis. We develop a method that can localize the origin of variability on the sky to better than one fifth of a pixel. Given measured frequencies of observed variability (e.g., from periodogram analysis), we show that the corresponding best-fit sinusoid amplitudes to raw light curves extracted from each pixel are distributed the same as light from the variable source. The primary assumption of this method is that other nearby stars are not variable at the same frequencies. Essentially, we are using the high frequency resolution of TESS to overcome limitations from its low spatial resolution. We have implemented our method in an open source Python package, TESS Localize (github.com/Higgins00/TESS-Localize), that determines the location of a variable source on the sky given TESS pixel data and a set of observed frequencies of variability. Our method utilizes the TESS Pixel Response Function models, and we characterize systematics in the residuals of fitting these models to data. Given the ubiquity of source blending in TESS light curves, verifying the source of observed variability should be a standard step in TESS analyses.},

However, the FFIs contain systematic effects such as pointing jitter and scattered light from the Earth and Moon that must be removed (i.e., "detrended") before downstream analysis. We present unpopular, an open-source Python package to obtain detrended TESS FFI light curves optimized for variable sources. The unpopular package implements a variant of the causal pixel model to remove systematics and allows for simultaneous fitting with a polynomial component to capture nontransit astrophysical variations, such as supernova signals or stellar variability, that tend to be removed in techniques optimized for exoplanet detection. We validate our method by detrending different sources (e.g., supernovae, tidal disruption events (TDEs), exoplanet-hosting stars, fast-rotating stars) and comparing our light curves to those obtained by other pipelines when appropriate. Our supernova and TDE light curves are visually similar to those obtained by others using the ISIS image subtraction package, indicating that unpopular can be used to extract multisector light curves by preserving astrophysical signals on timescales of a TESS sector ({\textasciitilde}27 days). We note that our method contains tuning parameters that are currently set heuristically, and that the optimal set of tuning parameters will likely depend on the particular signal the user is interested in obtaining.

The pipeline simultaneously produced the astrophysical parameters of a cluster. From literature we compiled a target list of presently known open and globular clusters, cluster candidates, associations, and moving groups. From established member stars we derived spatial parameters (coordinates of centres and radii of the main morphological parts of clusters) and cluster kinematics (average proper motions and sometimes radial velocities). For distance, reddening, and age determination we used specific sets of theoretical isochrones. Tidal parameters were obtained by a fit of three-parameter King profiles to the observed density distributions of members. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We investigated all 871 objects in the 2nd Galactic quadrant, of which we successfully treated 642 open clusters, 2 globular clusters, and 8 stellar associations. The remaining 219 objects (24\%) were recognised by us to be nonexistent clusters, duplicate entries, or clusters too faint for 2MAst. We found that our sample is complete in the 2nd quadrant up to a distance of 2 kpc, where the average surface density is 94 clusters per kpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Compared with literature values we found good agreement in spatial and kinematic data, as well as for optical distances and reddening. Small, but systematic offsets were detected in the age determination. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendices A-C are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}Catalogues are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/543/A156"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/543/A156{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {USNO-B1.0 and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) are the most widely used all-sky surveys. However, 2MASS has no proper motions at all, and USNO-B1.0 published only relative, not absolute (i.e., on the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRS), proper motions. We performed a new determination of mean positions and proper motions on the ICRS system by combining USNO-B1.0 and 2MASS astrometry. This catalog is called PPMXL (VO access to the catalog is possible via http://vo.uni-hd.de/ppmxl), and it aims to be completed from the brightest stars down to about V ≈ 20 all sky. PPMXL contains about 900 million objects, some 410 million with 2MASS photometry, and is the largest collection of ICRS proper motions at present. As representative for the ICRS, we chose PPMX. The recently released UCAC3 could not be used because we found plate-dependent distortions in its proper motion system north of -20° declination. UCAC3 served as an intermediate system for δ {\textless}= -20°. The resulting typical individual mean errors of the proper motions range from 4 mas yr-1 to more than 10 mas yr-1 depending on observational history. The mean errors of positions at epoch 2000.0 are 80-120 mas, if 2MASS astrometry could be used, 150-300 mas else. We also give correction tables to convert USNO-B1.0 observations of, e.g., minor planets to the ICRS system.},

	abstract = {Delta Scuti (δ Sct) stars have been extensively studied in our Galaxy but far less in extragalactic systems. Here we study the population of δ Sct variables in NGC 419, an intermediate-age globular cluster of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using g, r, and i Gemini-S/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) time-series observations. Our goal is to study the role of such variables in the cluster extended main-sequence turnoff (MSTO). We report the discovery of 54 δ Sct stars and three eclipsing binaries in the NGC 419 field. We find only a handful of the δ Sct stars at the MSTO of NGC 419, while the majority are fainter, indicating that the cluster is younger (≲1.2 Gyr) than previously thought. Considering their radial distribution, we identify only six δ Sct stars as probable members of NGC 419, while the 48 remaining are likely δ Sct stars of the SMC field. Cluster δ Sct stars appear close to the red edge of the MSTO, supporting the idea that the extended MSTO has its origin in an age spread. The 48 field δ Sct stars represent the largest detection of δ Sct stars made in the SMC. The period distribution of these newly detected δ Sct stars (0.04 day ≲ P ≲ 0.15 day) is similar to that detected in other systems. The amplitude distribution (0.05 mag ≲ Δr ≲ 0.60 mag) is likely biased because of the lack of low-amplitude stars. We finally use the δ Sct stars to calculate distances using different period-luminosity relations. The average distance moduli obtained are 18.76 ± 0.14 mag for NGC 419 and 18.86 ± 0.11 mag for the SMC field, which agree with previous measurements.},

	abstract = {The Cepheid period-luminosity (PL) relation is the key tool for measuring astronomical distances and for establishing the extragalactic distance scale. In particular, the local value of the Hubble constant (H0) strongly depends on Cepheid distance measurements. The recent Gaia Data Releases and other parallax measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) already enabled us to improve the accuracy of the slope (α) and intercept (β) of the PL relation. However, the dependence of this law on metallicity is still largely debated. In this paper, we combine three samples of Cepheids in the Milky Way (MW), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in order to derive the metallicity term (hereafter γ) of the PL relation. The recent publication of extremely precise LMC and SMC distances based on late-type detached eclipsing binary systems provides a solid anchor for the Magellanic Clouds. In the MW, we adopt Cepheid parallaxes from the early third Gaia Data Release. We derive the metallicity effect in V, I, J, H, KS, WVI, and WJK. In the KS band we report a metallicity effect of -0.221 ± 0.051 mag dex-1, the negative sign meaning that more metal-rich Cepheids are intrinsically brighter than their more metal-poor counterparts of the same pulsation period.},

	abstract = {In this paper we revise the relationship between ages and metallicities of LMC star clusters and their integrated UBV colors. The study stands on the catalog of UBV colors of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) clusters by Bica et al. (1994; BCDSP) and the photometric models of single stellar populations (SSP) calculated by Bertelli et al. (1994). These photometric models nicely describe the color distribution of LMC clusters in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) plane together with the observed dispersion of the colors and the existence of a gap in a certain region of this diagram. In the case of blue clusters, most of the dispersion in the colors can be accounted for by the presence of stochastic effects on the mass distribution of stars, whereas for the red ones additional dispersion's of {\textasciitilde}0.2dex in metallicity and of {\textasciitilde}0.05mag in color excess are needed. From comparing the observed distribution of integrated colors in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) diagram with the theoretical models, it turns out that: 1) The data are consistent with the presence of a gap (period of quiescence) in the history of cluster formation. If the age-metallicity relation (AMR) for the LMC obeys the simple model of chemical evolution, the gap is well evident and corresponds to the age interval {\textasciitilde}3Gyr to (12-15)Gyr. On the contrary, if the chemical enrichment has been much slower than in the simple model, so that intermediate age clusters are less metal rich, the gap is expected to occur over a much narrower color range and to be hidden by effects of color dispersion. 2) The bimodal distribution of B-V colors can be reproduced by a sequence of clusters almost evenly distributed in the logarithm of the age, whose metallicity is governed by a normal AMR. No need is found of the so-called phase transitions in the integrated colors of a cluster taking place at suitable ages (Renzini \&amp; Buzzoni 1986). 3) The gap noticed by BCDSP in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) plane can be explained by the particular direction along which cluster colors are dispersed in that part of the (U-B) vs. (B-V) diagram. Also in this case, no sudden changes in the integrated properties of clusters must be invoked. The results of this analysis are used to revise the empirical method proposed by Elson \&amp; Fall (1985, EF85) to attribute ages to LMC clusters according to their integrated UBV colors. We show that the EF85 method does not provide the correct relation between ages and colors for clusters of low metallicity and hence its inability to date the old clusters. We propose two modifications to the definition of the parameter S of EF85 such that the age sequence of red clusters is suitably described, and the intrinsic errors on ages caused by the heavy presence of various effects dispersing the colors are reduced to a minimum. The age sequence is calibrated on 24 template clusters for which ages were independently derived from recent color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). Finally, we attribute ages to all clusters present in BCDSP catalog, and derive the global age distribution function (ADF) for LMC clusters. The ADF presents new features that were not clear in previous analyses of UBV data, but were already suggested by a number of independent observational studies. The features in question are periods of enhanced cluster formation at {\textasciitilde}100Myr and 1-2Gyr, and a gap in the cluster formation history between {\textasciitilde}3 and (12-15)Gyr. The peaks observed in the distribution of B-V colors are found to be sensitive to the presence of these periods of enhanced cluster formation and the lack of extremely red clusters caused by the age gap between intermediate-age and old clusters.},

The Cepheid light curves are sampled with an average of 22 measurements per star fully covering the phase of each Cepheid. The J, H, and K light curves for each Cepheid were uniformly interpolated to find the intensity mean magnitudes within each band. The results are consistent within ±1\% for 26 stars in common with previous studies. This paper is the first in a projected series of two papers which will provide additional fundamental data for Cepheids in the Galaxy, namely, NIR photometry and line-of-sight extinction.

	abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} − G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

	abstract = {Context. Gaia has been in operations since 2014. The third Gaia data release expands from the early data release (EDR3) in 2020 by providing 34 months of multi-epoch observations that allowed us to probe, characterise and classify systematically celestial variable phenomena. Aims. We present a summary of the variability processing and analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic time series of 1.8 billion sources done for Gaia DR3. Methods. We used statistical and Machine Learning methods to characterise and classify the variable sources. Training sets were built from a global revision of major published variable star catalogues. For a subset of classes, specific detailed studies were conducted to confirm their class membership and to derive parameters that are adapted to the peculiarity of the considered class. Results. In total, 10.5 million objects are identified as variable in Gaia DR3 and have associated time series in G, GBP, and GRP and, in some cases, radial velocity time series. The DR3 variable sources subdivide into 9.5 million variable stars and 1 million Active Galactic Nuclei/Quasars. In addition, supervised classification identified 2.5 million galaxies thanks to spurious variability induced by the extent of these objects. The variability analysis output in the DR3 archive amounts to 17 tables containing a total of 365 parameters. We publish 35 types and sub-types of variable objects. For 11 variable types, additional specific object parameters are published. An overview of the estimated completeness and contamination of most variability classes is provided. Conclusions. Thanks to Gaia we present the largest whole-sky variability analysis based on coherent photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data. Later Gaia data releases will more than double the span of time series and the number of observations, thus allowing for an even richer catalogue in the future.},

	abstract = {Gaia DR3 publishes a catalogue of full-sky RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) observed during the initial 34 months of science operations, that were processed through the Specific Object Study (SOS) pipeline for Cepheids and RRLs (SOS Cep\&RRL) observed by Gaia. The SOS Cep\&RRL validation of DR3 candidate RRLs relies on tools that include the Period (P) G-amplitude diagram and the P-phi21 and -phi31 parameters of the G light curve Fourier decomposition, based on a sample of bona fide known RRLs (Gold Sample). The SOS processing led to a catalogue of 271779 RRLs listed in the vari\_rrlyrae table of DR3. By dropping sources that clearly are contaminants, or have an uncertain classification we produce the final catalogue of SOS-confirmed DR3 RRLs containing 270905 sources (174947 fundamental mode, 93952 first overtone and 2006 double-mode RRLs) confirmed and fully characterised by the SOS Cep\&RRL pipeline. They are distributed all over the sky, including 95 globular clusters and 25 Milky Way companions. RVS time series radial velocities are also published for 1096 RRLs and 799 Cepheids. Of the 270905 DR3 RRLs, 200294 are already known in the literature and 70611 are, to the best of our knowledge, new discoveries by Gaia. An estimate of the interstellar absorption is published for 142660 fundamental-mode RRLs from a relation based on the G-band amplitude and the pulsation period. Metallicities derived from the Periods and the phi31 Fourier parameters of the G-light curves are also released for 133559 RRLs. The final Gaia DR3 catalogue of confirmed RRLs almost doubles the DR2 RRLs catalogue. An increase of statistical significance, a better characterization of the RRLs pulsational and astrophysical parameters, and the improved astrometry published with Gaia EDR3, make the SOS Cep\&RRL DR3 sample, the largest, most homogeneous and parameter-rich catalogue of All-Sky RRLs published so far.},

These data provide a record of photometric variability across a range of astrophysically interesting time scales, probing stellar rotation, eclipsing binary systems, and pulsations. We have analyzed the TESS 2-min light curves to identify periodic variability on timescales 0.01-13 days, and explored the results across various stellar properties. We have identified over 40,000 periodic variables with high confidence, and another 50,000 with moderate confidence. These light curves show differences in variability type across the HR diagram, with distinct groupings of rotational, eclipsing, and pulsational variables. We also see interesting patterns across period-luminosity space, with clear correlations between period and luminosity for high-mass pulsators, evolved stars, and contact binary systems, a discontinuity corresponding to the Kraft break, and a lower occurrence of periodic variability in main-sequence stars at a timescale of 1.5 to 2 days.},

	abstract = {We present results from a new pipeline custom-designed to search for faint, undiscovered solar system bodies using full-frame image data from the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. This pipeline removes the baseline flux of each pixel before aligning and coadding frames along plausible orbital paths of interest. We first demonstrate the performance of the pipeline by recovering the signals of three trans-Neptunian objects—90377 Sedna (V = 20.64), 2015 BP519 (V = 21.81), and 2007 TG422 (V = 22.32)—both through shift-stacking along their known sky-projected paths and through a blind recovery. We then apply this blind-search procedure in a proof-of-concept survey of TESS Sectors 18 and 19, which extend through a portion of the Galactic plane in the Northern Hemisphere. We search for dim objects at geocentric distances d = 70-800 au in a targeted search for Planet Nine and any previously unknown detached Kuiper Belt objects that may shed light on the Planet Nine hypothesis. With no input orbital information, our present pipeline can reliably recover the signals of distant solar system bodies in the Galactic plane with V {\textless} 21 and current distances d ≲ 150 au, and we elaborate on paths forward to push these limits in future optimizations. The methods described in this paper will serve as a foundation for an all-sky shift-stacking survey of the distant solar system with TESS.},

While in other large families, these distributions are in general very similar to each other. We confirm that older families tend to contain a larger fraction of more spheroidal, low-amplitude asteroids. We found that rotation period distributions are different in the cores and outskirts of the Flora and Maria families, while the Vesta, Eos, and Eunomia families lack this feature. We also confirm that very fast spinning asteroids are close to spherical (or spinning top shapes), and minor planets rotating slower than ≈11 h are also more spherical than asteroids in the 4-8 h period range and this group is expected to contain the most elongated bodies.},

	abstract = {In the era of precision cosmology, it is essential to determine the Hubble constant empirically with an accuracy of one per cent or better1. At present, the uncertainty on this constant is dominated by the uncertainty in the calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity relationship2,3 (also known as the Leavitt law). The Large Magellanic Cloud has traditionally served as the best galaxy with which to calibrate Cepheid period-luminosity relations, and as a result has become the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale4,5. Eclipsing binary systems composed of late-type stars offer the most precise and accurate way to measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Currently the limit of the precision attainable with this technique is about two per cent, and is set by the precision of the existing calibrations of the surface brightness-colour relation5,6. Here we report a calibration of the surface brightness-colour relation with a precision of 0.8 per cent. We use this calibration to determine a geometrical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to 1 per cent based on 20 eclipsing binary systems. The final distance is 49.59 ± 0.09 (statistical) ± 0.54 (systematic) kiloparsecs.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a programme to determine the fundamental parameters of a substantial number of eclipsing binaries of spectral types O and B in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). New spectroscopic data, obtained with the two-degree-field (2dF) multi-object spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope, have been used in conjunction with photometry from the Optical Gravitational Lens Experiment (OGLE-II) data base of SMC eclipsing binaries. Previously we reported results for 10 systems; in this second and concluding paper we present spectral types, masses, radii, temperatures, surface gravities and luminosities for the components of a further 40 binaries. The uncertainties are typically +/-10 per cent on masses, +/-4 per cent on radii and +/-0.07 on logL. The full sample of 50 OB-type eclipsing systems is the largest single set of fundamental parameters determined for high-mass binaries in any galaxy. We find that 21 of the systems studied are in detached configurations, 28 are in semidetached post-mass-transfer states, and one is a contact binary. The overall properties of the detached systems are consistent with theoretical models for the evolution of single stars with SMC metal abundances (Z{\textasciitilde}= 0.004); in particular, observed and evolutionary masses are in excellent agreement. Although there are no directly applicable published models, the overall properties of the semidetached systems are consistent with them being in the slow phase of mass transfer in case A. About 40 per cent of these semidetached systems show photometric evidence of orbital-phase-dependent absorption by a gas stream falling from the inner Lagrangian point on the secondary star towards the primary star. This sample demonstrates that case-A mass transfer is a common occurrence amongst high-mass binaries with initial orbital periods P{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 5 d, and that this slow phase has a comparable duration to the detached phase preceding it. Each system provides a primary distance indicator. We find a mean distance modulus to the SMC of 18.91 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.1 (internal and external uncertainties; D= 60.6 +/- 1.0 +/- 2.8 kpc). This value represents one of the most precise available determinations of the distance to the SMC.},

	abstract = {Turbulent neutral hydrogen (H I) line widths are often thought to be driven primarily by star formation (SF), but the timescale for converting SF energy to H I kinetic energy is unclear. As a complication, studies on the connection between H I line widths and SF in external galaxies often use broadband tracers for the SF rate, which must implicitly assume that SF histories (SFHs) have been constant over the timescale of the tracer. In this paper, we compare measures of H I energy to time-resolved SFHs in a number of nearby dwarf galaxies. We find that H I energy surface density is strongly correlated only with SF that occurred 30-40 Myr ago. This timescale corresponds to the approximate lifetime of the lowest mass supernova progenitors ({\textasciitilde}8 M ⊙). This analysis suggests that the coupling between SF and the neutral interstellar medium is strongest on this timescale, due either to an intrinsic delay between the release of the peak energy from SF or to the coherent effects of many supernova explosions during this interval. At ΣSFR {\textgreater} 10-3 M ⊙ yr-1 kpc-2, we find a mean coupling efficiency between SF energy and H I energy of epsilon = 0.11 ± 0.04 using the 30-40 Myr timescale. However, unphysical efficiencies are required in lower ΣSFR systems, implying that SF is not the primary driver of H I kinematics at ΣSFR {\textless} 10-3 M ⊙ yr-1 kpc-2.},

New light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission for this star allow precise stellar activity characterization over more than a decade timescale. We have carried out the first flare and starspot analysis of GJ 1243 from over 50 days of data from TESS Sectors 14 and 15. Using 133 flare events detected in the 2 minute cadence TESS data, we compare the cumulative flare frequency distributions, and find the flare activity for GJ 1243 is unchanged between the Kepler and TESS epochs. Two distinct starspot groups are found in the TESS data, with the primary spot having the same rotational period and phase as seen in Kepler. The phase of the secondary spot feature is consistent with the predicted location of the secondary starspot and measurement of weak differential rotation, suggesting this secondary spot may be long-lived and stable in both latitude and longitude. As expected for this highly active star, the constant spot and flare activity reveal no sign of solar-like activity cycles over 10 yr. However, we highlight the unique ability for Kepler and TESS to use flare rates to detect activity cycles.},

	abstract = {We present synthetic far- and near-ultraviolet (\{FUV\} and \{NUV\}) maps of M31, both with and without dust reddening. These maps were constructed from spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from optical Hubble Space Telescope imaging of resolved stars, taken as part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program. We use stellar population synthesis modeling to generate synthetic UV maps with a spatial resolution of ∼100 pc (∼24 arcsec), projected. When reddening is included, these maps reproduce all of the main morphological features in the GALEX imaging, including rings and large star-forming complexes. The predicted UV flux also agrees well with the observed flux, with median ratios between the modeled and observed flux of \{\{log\}\}10(\{f\}\{FUV\}\{syn\}/\{f\}\{FUV\}\{obs\})=0.03+/- 0.24 and \{\{log\}\}10(\{f\}\{NUV\}\{syn\}/\{f\}\{NUV\}\{obs\})=-0.03+/- 0.16 in the \{FUV\} and \{NUV\}, respectively. This agreement is particularly impressive given that we used only optical photometry to construct these UV maps. Having verified the synthetic reddened maps, we use the dust-free maps to examine properties of obscured flux and star formation. We compare our dust-free and reddened maps of \{FUV\} flux with the observed GALEX \{FUV\} flux and \{FUV\} + 24 μm flux to examine the fraction of obscured flux. We find that the maps of synthetic flux require that ∼90\% of the \{FUV\} flux in M31 is obscured by dust, while the GALEX -based methods suggest that ∼70\% of the \{FUV\} flux is absorbed by dust. This 30\% increase in the estimate of the obscured flux is driven by significant differences between the dust-free synthetic \{FUV\} flux and that derived when correcting the observed \{FUV\} flux for dust absorption with 24 μm emission observations. The difference is further illustrated when we compare the SFRs derived from the \{FUV\} + 24 μm flux with the 100 Myr average SFR from the CMD-based SFHs. We find that the 24 μm corrected \{FUV\} flux underestimates the SFR by a factor of 2.3-2.5, depending on the chosen calibration. This discrepancy could be reduced by allowing for variability in the weight applied to the 24 μm data, as has been recently suggested in the literature.

We divide the PHATTER optical survey into 2005 regions that measure 24 arcsec, {\textasciitilde}100 pc, on a side and fit color-magnitude diagrams for each region individually to measure the spatially resolved SFH of M33 within the PHATTER footprint. There are significant fluctuations in the SFH on small spatial scales and also galaxy-wide scales that we measure back to about 630 Myr ago. We observe a more flocculent spiral structure in stellar populations younger than about 80 Myr, while the structure of the older stellar populations is dominated by two spiral arms. We also observe a bar in the center of M33, which dominates at ages older than about 80 Myr. Finally, we find that the mean star formation rate (SFR) over the last 100 Myr within the PHATTER footprint is 0.32 ± 0.02 M⊙ yr-1. We measure a current SFR (over the last 10 Myr) of 0.20 ± 0.03 M⊙ yr-1.

About 85\% of the Local Volume population are dwarf (dIr, dIm, and dSph) galaxies with MB{\textgreater}-17.0, which contribute about 4\% to the local luminosity density, and roughly 10\%-15\% to the local H I mass density. The H I mass-to-luminosity and the H I mass-to-total (indicative) mass ratios increase systematically from giant galaxies toward dwarfs, reaching maximum values about 5 in solar units for the most tiny objects. For the Local Volume disklike galaxies, their H I masses and angular momentum follow Zasov's linear relation, expected for rotating gaseous disks being near the threshold of gravitational instability, favorable for active star formation. We found that the mean local luminosity density exceeds 1.7-2.0 times the global density, in spite of the presence of the Tully void and the absence of rich clusters in the Local Volume. The mean local H I density is 1.4 times its ``global'' value derived from the H I Parkes Sky Survey. However, the mean local baryon density Ωb({\textless}8Mpc)=2.3\% consists of only a half of the global baryon density, Ωb=(4.7+/-0.6)\% (Spergel et al., published in 2003). The mean-square pairwise difference of radial velocities is about 100 km s-1 for spatial separations within 1 Mpc, increasing to {\textasciitilde}300 km s-1 on a scale of {\textasciitilde}3 Mpc. also We calculated the integral area of the sky occupied by the neighboring galaxies. Assuming the H I size of spiral and irregular galaxies to be 2.5 times their standard optical diameter and ignoring any evolution effect, we obtain the expected number of the line-of-sight intersections with the H I galaxy images to be dn/dz{\textasciitilde}0.4, which does not contradict the observed number of absorptions in QSO spectra.},

	abstract = {Context. Measuring star formation on a local scale is important to constrain star formation laws. It is not clear yet, however, whether and how the measure of star formation is affected by the spatial scale at which a galaxy is observed. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We wish to understand the impact of the resolution on the determination of the spatially resolved star formation rate (SFR) and other directly associated physical parameters such as the attenuation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We carried out a multi-scale, pixel-by-pixel study of the nearby galaxy M 33. Assembling FUV, Hα, 8 μm, 24 μm, 70 μm, and 100 μm maps, we have systematically compared the emission in individual bands with various SFR estimators from a resolution of 33 pc to 2084 pc. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: There are strong, scale-dependent, discrepancies of up to a factor 3 between monochromatic SFR estimators and Hα+24 μm. The scaling factors between individual IR bands and the SFR show a strong dependence on the spatial scale and on the intensity of star formation. Finally, strong variations of the differential reddening between the nebular emission and the stellar continuum are seen, depending on the specific SFR (sSFR) and on the resolution. At the finest spatial scales, there is little differential reddening at high sSFR. The differential reddening increases with decreasing sSFR. At the coarsest spatial scales the differential reddening is compatible with the canonical value found for starburst galaxies. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results confirm that monochromatic estimators of the SFR are unreliable at scales smaller than 1 kpc. Furthermore, the extension of local calibrations to high-redshift galaxies presents non-trivial challenges because the properties of these systems may be poorly known. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The maps (FITS files) and the data cube used in this article are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/578/A8"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/578/A8{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

We develop a simple analytic model for the cluster mass-radius relation. We consider a galaxy disc in hydrostatic equilibrium, which hosts a population of molecular clouds that fragment into clumps undergoing cluster formation and feedback-driven expansion. The model predicts a mass-radius relation of \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}{\textbackslash}propto M\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\$ and a dependence on the kpc-scale gas surface density \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}{\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}Sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}rm g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}\$, which results from the formation of more compact clouds (and cluster-forming clumps within) at higher gas surface densities. This environmental dependence implies that the high-pressure environments in which the most massive clusters can form also induce the formation of clusters with the smallest radii, thereby shallowing the observed MRR at high-masses towards the observed \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}{\textbackslash}propto M\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}\$. At low cluster masses, relaxation-driven expansion induces a similar shallowing of the MRR. We combine our predicted MRR with a simple population synthesis model and apply it to a variety of star-forming environments, finding good agreement. Our model predicts that the high-pressure formation environments of globular clusters at high redshift naturally led to the formation of clusters that are considerably more compact than those in the local Universe, thereby increasing their resilience to tidal shock-driven disruption and contributing to their survival until the present day.},

From an examination of over 18 000 stars in TESS sectors 1-7, we have discovered high-frequency pulsations in 14 A-F stars, of which only 3 are classified as Ap stars. In addition to these new discoveries, we discuss the frequencies in nine previously known roAp stars. In one of these stars, HD 60435, we confirm a previous finding that the pulsations have lifetimes of only a few days. In another known roAp star, HD 6532, the relative amplitudes of the rotationally modulated sidelobes, which are generally used to estimate the inclination of the magnetic axis relative to the rotational axis, are significantly different from those found in ground-based B-band photometric observations. We also discuss four δ Scuti stars that appear to have independent frequencies similar to those of roAp stars.},

	abstract = {The properties of young star clusters formed within a galaxy are thought to vary in different interstellar medium conditions, but the details of this mapping from galactic to cluster scales are poorly understood due to the large dynamic range involved in galaxy and star cluster formation. We introduce a new method for modelling cluster formation in galaxy simulations: mapping giant molecular clouds (GMCs) formed self-consistently in a FIRE-2 magnetohydrodynamic galaxy simulation on to a cluster population according to a GMC-scale cluster formation model calibrated to higher resolution simulations, obtaining detailed properties of the galaxy's star clusters in mass, metallicity, space, and time. We find \${\textbackslash}sim 10\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of all stars formed in the galaxy originate in gravitationally bound clusters overall, and this fraction increases in regions with elevated Σgas and ΣSFR, because such regions host denser GMCs with higher star formation efficiency. These quantities vary systematically over the history of the galaxy, driving variations in cluster formation. The mass function of bound clusters varies - no single Schechter-like or power-law distribution applies at all times. In the most extreme episodes, clusters as massive as 7 × 106 M⊙ form in massive, dense clouds with high star formation efficiency. The initial mass-radius relation of young star clusters is consistent with an environmentally dependent 3D density that increases with Σgas and ΣSFR. The model does not reproduce the age and metallicity statistics of old (\$ 11{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\$) globular clusters found in the Milky Way, possibly because it forms stars more slowly at z {\textgreater} 3.},

	abstract = {The integrated galaxial initial mass function (IGIMF) is the relevant distribution function containing the information on the distribution of stellar remnants, the number of supernovae, and the chemical enrichment history of a galaxy. Since most stars form in embedded star clusters with different masses, the IGIMF becomes an integral of the assumed (universal or invariant) stellar IMF over the embedded star cluster mass function (ECMF). For a range of reasonable assumptions about the IMF and the ECMF we find the IGIMF to be steeper (containing fewer massive stars per star) than the stellar IMF, but below a few solar masses it is invariant and identical to the stellar IMF for all galaxies. However, the steepening sensitively depends on the form of the ECMF in the low-mass regime. Furthermore, observations indicate a relation between the star formation rate of a galaxy and the most massive young stellar cluster in it. The assumption that this cluster mass marks the upper end of a young-cluster mass function leads to a connection of the star formation rate and the slope of the IGIMF above a few solar masses. The IGIMF varies with the star formation history of a galaxy. Notably, large variations of the IGIMF are evident for dE, dIrr, and LSB galaxies with a small to modest stellar mass. We find that for any galaxy the number of supernovae per star (NSNS) is suppressed relative to that expected for a Salpeter IMF. Dwarf galaxies have a smaller NSNS than massive galaxies. For dwarf galaxies the NSNS varies substantially depending on the galaxy assembly history and the assumptions made about the low-mass end of the ECMF. The findings presented here may be of some consequence for the cosmological evolution of the number of supernovae per low-mass star and the chemical enrichment of galaxies of different mass.},

Direct evidence on the value of n is found in the relative distribution, perpendicular to the galactic plane, of gas and young objects. For various values of n, computations were made of the initial luminosity function, the rate of star formation, the exchange of gas between stars and interstellar medium, the number of white dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the abundance of helium. It is concluded, from a comparison of the results with observational data, that n is around 2. The present rate of star formation, then, is five times slower than the average rate. The interstellar gas, of which the surface density on the galactic plane was taken to be 11 per square parsec, loses 1.4 O/pc2 per 10 years by the formation of stars but gains about one-third of this by ejection of gas from evolving stars. The present helium abundance of the interstellar gas may be explained if a star has burned, on the average, 53 per cent of its original hydrogen into helium at the time that ejection takes place. The ejected material was assumed to have a composition equal to the average composition of the star. The effect of star formation on the gas density in the galactic system and other galaxies is briefly discussed.},

The situation regarding low-mass stars in the field and in clusters, high-mass stars and intermediate-mass stars in clusters and associations of the Milky Way and LMC, pre-main sequence objects in visible and embedded clusters, and the IMF in galaxies more distant than the Magellanic Clouds is discussed, with an emphasis on the sources of uncertainty. Most of these uncertainties, especially radial mass segregation and unresolved binaries, would steepen the true IMF relative to the apparent IMF. Several cases of apparently large variations in cluster IMFs are pointed out, and a graphical comparison of results for about 60 clusters shows a spread of at least unity in the logarithmic IMF index for all mass ranges above about 1 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}sun\}\$. I conclude that either: 1. The uncertainties are so large that very little can be said about an average IMF or IMF variations; or 2. If the observations are taken at face value, there are strong indications of IMF variations, which do not seem to correlate with obvious environmental conditions like metallicity or stellar density. If there is an average IMF, I suggest that it is steepest at intermediate masses. If the variations are real, they offer a useful test of theoretical models.},

	abstract = {We show that using either the method of Page \& Carrera or the well-known 1/Va method to construct the binned luminosity function (LF) of a flux limited sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can produce an artificial flattening (or steepening in the case of negative evolution) of the binned LF for bins intersected by the flux cutoff of the sample. This effect is more pronounced for samples with steep and strongly evolving parent LFs but is still present even for non-evolving LFs. As a result of this distortion of the true LF, fitting a model LF to binned data may lead to errors in the estimation of the parameters and may even prompt the erroneous use of broken power-law functions. We compute the expected positions of apparent breaks in the binned LF. We show that these spurious breaks in the binned LFs can be avoided if the binning is done in the flux-redshift plane instead of the typically used luminosity-redshift plane. Binning in the flux-redshift plane can be used in conjunction with the binning in the luminosity-redshift plane to test for real breaks in the binned LFs and to identify the features that are the result of binning biases. We illustrate this effect for most typical forms of luminosity dependence and redshift evolution and show how the proposed method helps address this problem. We also apply this method to the MOJAVE AGN sample and show that it eliminates an apparent break in the binned LF.},

The data reveal a partition of the sample into lowest mass objects (Mecl {\textless}= 102Msolar), moderate mass clusters (102Msolar {\textless} Mecl {\textless}= 103Msolar) and rich clusters above 103Msolar. Additionally, there is a plateau of a constant maximal star mass (mmax {\textasciitilde} 25Msolar) for clusters with masses between 103Msolar and 4 × 103Msolar. Statistical tests of this data set reveal that the hypothesis of random sampling from the IMF between 0.01 and 150Msolar is highly unlikely for star clusters more massive than 102Msolar with a probability of p {\textasciitilde} 2 × 10-7 for the objects with Mecl between 102 and 103Msolar and p {\textasciitilde} 3 × 10-9 for the more massive star clusters. Also, the spread of mmax values at a given Mecl is smaller than expected from random sampling. We suggest that the basic physical process able to explain this dependence of stellar inventory of a star cluster on its mass may be the interplay between stellar feedback and the binding energy of the cluster-forming molecular cloud core. Given these results, it would follow that an integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) sampled from such clusters would automatically be steeper in comparison to the IMF within individual star clusters.},

	abstract = {We obtain constraints on the slope of a universal stellar initial mass function (IMF) over a range of model cosmic star formation histories (SFHs) using z{\textasciitilde}0.1 luminosity densities in the range from 0.2 to 2.2 μm. The age-IMF degeneracy of the integrated spectra of stellar populations can be broken for the universe as a whole by using direct measurements of (relative) cosmic SFH from high-redshift observations. These have only marginal dependence on uncertainties in the IMF, whereas fitting to local luminosity densities depends strongly on both cosmic SFH and the IMF. We fit to these measurements using population synthesis and find the best-fit IMF power-law slope to be Γ=1.15+/-0.2 (assuming dN/dlogm{\textasciitilde}m-Γ for 0.5-120 Msolar and m-0.5 for 0.1-0.5 Msolar). This M{\textgreater}0.5 Msolar slope is in good agreement with the Salpeter IMF slope (Γ=1.35). A strong upper limit of Γ{\textless}1.7 is obtained, which effectively rules out the Scalo IMF because its fraction of high-mass stars is too low. This upper limit is at the 99.7\% confidence level if we assume a closed-box chemical evolution scenario and 95\% if we assume constant solar metallicity. Fitting to the Hα line luminosity density, we obtain a best-fit IMF slope in good agreement with that derived from broadband measurements. Marginalizing over cosmic SFH and IMF slope, we obtain (95\% confidence ranges) Ωstars=(1.1-2.0)×10-3 h-1 for the stellar mass density, ρSFR=(0.7-4.1)×10-2 h Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 for the star formation rate density, and ρL=(1.2-1.7)×1035 h W Mpc-3 for the bolometric, attenuated, stellar luminosity density (0.09-5 μm).

	abstract = {We examine the growth of the stellar content of galaxies from z= 3 → 0 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating parametrized galactic outflows. Without outflows, galaxies overproduce stellar masses (M*) and star formation rates (SFRs) compared to observations. Winds introduce a three-tier form for the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate functions, where the middle tier depends on the differential (i.e. mass-dependent) recycling of ejected wind material back into galaxies. A tight M*-SFR relation is a generic outcome of all these simulations and its evolution is well described as being powered by cold accretion, although current observations at z≳ 2 suggest that the star formation in small early galaxies must be highly suppressed. Roughly, one-third of z= 0 galaxies at masses below M★ are satellites and the star formation in satellites is not much burstier than in centrals. All models fail to suppress the star formation and stellar mass growth in massive galaxies at z≲ 2, indicating the need for an external quenching mechanism such as black hole feedback. All models also fail to produce dwarfs as young and rapidly star forming as observed. An outflow model following scalings expected for momentum-driven winds broadly matches the observed galaxy evolution around M★ from z= 0 to 3, which is a significant success since these galaxies dominate cosmic star formation, but the failures at higher and lower masses highlight the challenges still faced by this class of models. We argue that central star-forming galaxies are well described as living in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflows from gravity and recycled winds, star formation, and strong and ubiquitous outflows that regulate how much inflow forms into stars. Star-forming galaxy evolution is thus primarily governed by the continual cycling of baryons between galaxies and intergalactic gas.},

	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\textasciitilde}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass σ{\textasciitilde}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\textasciitilde}0.2 Msolar and σ{\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\textasciitilde}n*{\textasciitilde}0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfvénic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability. The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

	abstract = {The combination of a finite timescale for star formation, rapid early stellar evolution, and rapid stellar dynamical processes imply that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) cannot be inferred for any star cluster independently of its age (the Cluster IMF Theorem). The IMF can nevertheless be constrained statistically by evolving many theoretical populations drawn from one parent distribution and testing these against observed populations. It follows that all known well-resolved stellar populations are consistent with having been drawn from the same parent mass distribution. The IMF Universality Hypothesis cannot therefore be discarded despite the existence of the Cluster IMF Theorem. This means that the currently existing star formation theory fails to describe the stellar outcome because it predicts a dependency of the IMF on the physical boundary conditions, which is not observed. The Integrated Galactic IMF Theorem, however, predicts a variation of galaxy-wide IMFs in dependence on the galaxy's star formation rate even if the IMF Universality Hypothesis is valid. This variation has now been observed in SDSS galaxy data. Detailed analysis of the binary properties in the very low mass star and brown dwarf mass regime on the one hand and in the stellar regime on the other shows there to be a discontinuity in the IMF near 0.1 M⊙ such that brown dwarfs follow a separate distribution function. Very recent observations of the stellar population within 1 pc of the nucleus of the Milky Way do suggest a top-heavy IMF, perhaps hinting at a variation in the star formation outcome with tidal field and temperature, thereby violating the IMF Universality Hypothesis under these physically extreme conditions. Another violation of this hypothesis appears to emerge for extremely metal-poor stars, such that the primordial IMF appears to have been depleted in low mass stars.},

	abstract = {The initial mass function (IMF) for stars is proposed to result from two distinct physical processes that determine its shape separately in two intervals of mass: random sampling of mass in a fractal cloud gives the power-law portion at intermediate to high mass, and insufficient self-gravity at the local temperature and pressure gives the cutoff at low mass. The entire function is modeled numerically, with the assumption that a star's mass is proportional to the mass of the piece of cloud in which it forms. The results typically give an IMF with the Salpeter value for the slope and a flattening at a low mass. There is little sensitivity to parameters at masses greater than the cutoff, although slightly shallower IMFs might be expected in regions with high levels of ionization and turbulence. The low-mass cutoff is essentially the thermal Jeans mass in the star-forming cloud; models with a high value of this mass produce a truncated IMF similar to that proposed for starburst galaxies. The mass of the largest star increases with total stellar mass because of the stochastic nature of the model. The star IMF is steeper than the cloud mass spectrum because of competition for mass and the density dependence of star formation.},

It is usuallydescribed as being invariant, but evidence to the contrary has emerged: it appears to become top-heavy when the star-formation rate density surpasses about 0.1 M\_\{odot\}/(year \{pc\}3) ona pc scale and it may become increasingly bottom-heavy withincreasing metallicity and in increasingly massive elliptical galaxies. Itdeclines quite steeply below about 0.07 M\_\{odot \} with brown dwarfs (BDs) and very low mass stars having their own IMF. The most massive star of mass m max formed in an embedded cluster with stellar mass M ecl correlates strongly with M ecl being a result of gravitation-driven but resource-limited growth and fragmentation-induced starvation. There is no convincing evidence whatsoeverthat massive stars do form in isolation. Massive stars form above a density threshold in embedded clusters which become saturated when m\_\{max\} = m\_\{max\{ast\}\}≈ 150 M\_\{odot \} which appears to be the canonical physical upper mass limit of stars. Super-canonical massive stars arise naturally due to stellar mergers induced bystellar-dynamical encounters in binary-rich very young dense clusters.},

In addition, an Initial Mass Function (IMF) for the solar neighborhood is derived by combining the star counts with models of main sequence stellar evolution. Also, an approximation of the IMF per unit surface of the galactic disk is given. It is also shown that the observed surface density of supergiants of different spectral types and luminosity classes is consistent with the large mass-loss evolutionary models of Chiosi et al.

Finally, an estimation is given of the surface luminosity and the colors of the galactic disk in the solar neighborhood, and it is shown that the properties of the solar neighborhood are comparable to the integrated properties of Sc galaxies.},

This review critically examines reports of IMF variations, with a view toward whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a universal system IMF: a power law of Salpeter index (Γ = 1.35) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power law (Γ ∼ 0-0.25) for lower mass stars. The shape and universality of the substellar IMF is still under investigation. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a universal IMF, suggesting no gross variations over much of cosmic time. Indications of “nonstandard” IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments clearly warrant further study. However, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars.},

Here, it is shown by comparing the NGC 4214 results with observations from the Milky Way that NGC 4214 agrees very well with the predictions of the mmax - Mecl relation and with the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function theory. The difference in conclusions is based on a high degree of degeneracy between expectations from random sampling and those from the mmax - Mecl relation, but are also due to interpreting mmax as a truncation mass in a randomly sampled initial mass function. Additional analysis of galaxies with lower SFRs than those currently presented in the literature will be required to break this degeneracy.},

Here, we investigate simulations of the formation of Milky Way analogues run ab initio with an empirically derived metallicity-dependent IMF and the moving-mesh code AREPO in order to characterize the associated uncertainties. In particular, we compare a constant Chabrier and a varying metallicity-dependent IMF in cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes. We find that the non-linear effects due to IMF variations typically have a limited impact on the morphology and the star formation histories of the formed galaxies. Our results support the view that constraints on stellar-to-halo mass ratios, feedback strength, metallicity evolution, and metallicity distributions are in part degenerate with the effects of a non-universal, metallicity-dependent IMF. Interestingly, the empirical relation we use between metallicity and the high-mass slope of the IMF does not aid in the quenching process. It actually produces up to a factor of 2-3 more stellar mass if feedback is kept constant. Additionally, the enrichment history and the z = 0 metallicity distribution are significantly affected. In particular, the alpha enhancement pattern shows a steeper dependence on iron abundance in the metallicity-dependent model, in better agreement with observational constraints.},

The IMF shapes the stellar population in all stellar systems, and so has become one of the most fundamental concepts of modern astronomy. Both constant and variable IMFs across different environments have been claimed despite a large number of theoretical5-7 and observational efforts8-15. However, the measurement of the IMF in Galactic stellar populations has been limited by the relatively small number of photometrically observed stars, leading to high uncertainties12-16. Here we report a star-counting result based on approximately 93,000 spectroscopically observed M-dwarf stars, an order of magnitude more than previous studies, in the 100-300 parsec solar neighbourhood. We find unambiguous evidence of a variable IMF that depends on both metallicity and stellar age. Specifically, the stellar population formed at early times contains fewer low-mass stars compared with the canonical IMF, independent of stellar metallicities. In more recent times, however, the proportion of low-mass stars increases with stellar metallicity. The variable abundance of low-mass stars in our Milky Way establishes a powerful benchmark for models of star formation and can heavily affect results in Galactic chemical-enrichment modelling, mass estimation of galaxies and planet-formation efficiency.},

	abstract = {We use a recently developed analytic model for the interstellar medium (ISM) structure from scales of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) through star-forming cores to explore how the pre-stellar core mass function (CMF) and, by extrapolation, stellar initial mass function (IMF) should depend on both local and galactic properties. If the ISM is supersonically turbulent, the statistical properties of the density field follow from the turbulent velocity spectrum, and the excursion set formalism can be applied to analytically calculate the mass function of collapsing cores on the smallest scales on which they are self-gravitating (non-fragmenting). Two parameters determine the model: the disc-scale Mach number \{M\}h (which sets the shape of the CMF) and the absolute velocity/surface density (to assign an absolute scale). We show that, for normal variation in disc properties and gas temperatures in cores in the Milky Way and local galaxies, there is almost no variation in the high-mass behaviour of the CMF/IMF. The slope is always close to Salpeter down to ≲ 1 M⊙. We predict modest variation in the sub-solar regime, mostly from variation in \{M\}h, but this is consistent with the ∼1σ observed scatter in sub-solar IMFs in local regions. For fixed global (galaxy) properties, there is little variation in shape or `upper mass limit' with parent GMC mass or density. However, in extreme starbursts - ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and merging galaxy nuclei - we predict a bottom-heavy CMF. This agrees well with the IMF recently inferred for the centres of Virgo ellipticals, believed to have formed in such a process. The CMF is bottom heavy despite the gas temperature being an order of magnitude larger, because \{M\}h is also much larger. Larger \{M\}h values make the `parent' cloud mass (the turbulent Jeans mass) larger, but promote fragmentation to smaller scales (set by the sonic mass, not the Jeans mass); this shifts the turnover mass and also steepens the slope of the low-mass CMF. The model may also predict a top-heavy CMF for the in situ star formation in the sub-pc disc around Sgr A*, but the relevant input parameters are uncertain.},

	abstract = {We calculate the stellar integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) in the presence of cluster-to-cluster variations of the IMF. Variations of the IMF for a population of coeval clusters that populate the initial cluster mass function (ICLMF) are taken into account in the form of Gaussian distribution functions of the IMF parameters. For the tapered power-law function used in this work, these are the slope at the high-mass end, Γ, the slope at the low-mass end, γ, and the characteristic mass M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ch{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The level of variations is modeled by varying the width of the Gaussian distributions. The reference values are the standard deviations of the parameters observed for the population of young clusters in the present-day Milky Way, which are σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Γ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.6, σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}γ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.25, and σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ch{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.27 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We find that increasing the levels of dispersion for γ and Γ tends to moderately flatten the IGIMF at the low and high-mass end, respectively. The characteristic mass of the IGIMF is, however, strongly impacted by variations in M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ch{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Increasing the value of σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ch{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} shifts the peak of the IGIMF to lower masses, rendering the IGIMF more bottom heavy. This can provide a simple explanation for the bottom-heavy stellar mass function that is inferred for early-type galaxies since these are likely the result of a merger of disk galaxies where the physical conditions of the star-forming gas may vary significantly both in time and space in the merging system. The effect of IMF variations on the IGIMF is compared to the effects of other processes and sources of systematic variations such as those due to variations in the shape of ICLMF, the gas-phase metallicity, and the galactic star formation rate (SFR) which can potentially affect the maximum mass of stellar clusters in a galaxy and set the mean value of the characteristic mass in clusters. For the various dependencies we have explored, we found that the effect of IMF variations is a dominant factor that always affects the characteristic mass of the IGIMF. For the regimes at low metallicity where the IGIMF resembles a single power law, an increased level of IMF variations renders the IGIMF steeper and more bottom heavy, especially at low SFRs. On the other hand, variations in the IMF in the high mass regime can be easily dominated by variations in the slope of the ICLMF. We compare our results of the metallicity and SFR-dependent IGIMF to a sample of Milky Way ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) satellite galaxies that have available metallicity measurements. The present-day stellar mass function of these galaxies is a good analog to the IGIMF at the time their overall population of stars formed. We show that the slope of the stellar mass function of the UFD galaxies measured for stars in the mass range [0.4, 0.8] M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} can only be reproduced when IMF variations of the same order as those measured in the present-day Milky Way are included. Our results suggest that the inclusion of IMF variations in models of galaxy formation and evolution is of vital importance in order to improve our understanding of star formation and star formation feedback effects on galactic scales. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The grid of IGIMF models is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/666/A113"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/666/A113{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

While much is known about how galaxies globally and their stars individually form and evolve, one fundamental property that affects both remains elusive. This is problematic because this key property, the birth mass distribution of stars, referred to as the stellar initial mass function, is a key tracer of the physics of star formation that underpins almost all of the unknowns in galaxy and stellar evolution. It is perhaps the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in star and galaxy evolution. The past decade has seen a growing variety of methods for measuring or inferring the initial mass function. This range of approaches and evolving definitions of the quantity being measured has in turn led to conflicting conclusions regarding whether or not the initial mass function is universal. Here I review this growing wealth of approaches, and highlight the importance of considering potential initial mass function variations, reinforcing the need to carefully quantify the scope and uncertainties of measurements. I present a new framework to aid the discussion of the initial mass function and promote clarity in the further development of this fundamental field.},

We propose a method to uncover the range of variation of the parameters that describe the shape of the IMF for the population of young Galactic clusters.These parameters are the slopes in the low and high stellar mass regimes, γ and Γ, respectively, and the characteristic mass, Mch. The method relies exclusively on the high-mass content of the clusters, but is able to yield information on the distributions of parameters that describe the IMF over the entire stellar mass range. This is achieved by comparing the fractions of single and lonely massive O stars in a recent catalogue of the Milky Way clusters with a library of simulated clusters built with various distribution functions of the IMF parameters. The synthetic clusters are corrected for the effects of the binary population, stellar evolution, sample incompleteness, and ejected O stars. Our findings indicate that broad distributions of the IMF parameters are required in order to reproduce the fractions of single and lonely O stars in Galactic clusters. They also do not lend support to the existence of a cluster mass-maximum stellar mass relation. We propose a probabilistic formulation of the IMF whereby the parameters of the IMF are described by Gaussian distribution functions centred around γ = 0.91, Γ = 1.37, and Mch = 0.41 M⊙, and with dispersions of σγ = 0.25, σΓ = 0.60, and σ \_\{M\_\{ch\}\}=0.27 M⊙ around these values.},

	abstract = {As a young massive cluster in the central molecular zone, the Arches cluster is a valuable probe of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in the extreme Galactic center environment. We use multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope observations to obtain high-precision proper-motion and photometric measurements of the cluster, calculating cluster membership probabilities for stars down to ∼1.8 M ⊙ between cluster radii of 0.25 and 3.0 pc. We achieve a cluster sample with just ∼6\% field contamination, a significant improvement over photometrically selected samples that are severely compromised by the differential extinction across the field. Combining this sample with K-band spectroscopy of five cluster members, we forward model the Arches cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and other properties (such as age and total mass) while accounting for observational uncertainties, completeness, mass segregation, and stellar multiplicity. We find that the Arches IMF is best described by a one-segment power law that is significantly top-heavy: α = 1.80 ± 0.05 (stat) ± 0.06 (sys), where dN/dm ∝ m -α , though we cannot discount a two-segment power-law model with a high-mass slope only slightly shallower than local star-forming regions (α =\{2.04\}-0.19+0.14+/- 0.04) but with a break at \{5.8\}-1.2+3.2+/- 0.02 \{M\}⊙ . In either case, the Arches IMF is significantly different than the standard IMF. Comparing the Arches to other young massive clusters in the Milky Way, we find tentative evidence for a systematically top-heavy IMF at the Galactic center.},

	abstract = {Recent papers have found that the inferred slope of the high-mass ({\textgreater}1.5 M⊙) initial mass function (IMF) for field stars in the solar vicinity has a larger value (∼1.7-2.1) than the slopes (∼1.2-1.7; Salpeter=1.35) inferred from numerous studies of young clusters. We attempt to reconcile this apparent contradiction. Stars mostly form in Giant Molecular Clouds, and the more massive stars (≳3 M⊙) may have insufficient time before their deaths to uniformly populate the solar circle of the Galaxy. We examine the effect of small sample volumes on the apparent slope, Γapp, of the high-mass IMF by modelling the present-day mass function (PDMF) over the mass range 1.5-6 M⊙. Depending on the location of the observer along the solar circle and the size of the sample volume, the apparent slope of the IMF can show a wide variance, with typical values steeper than the underlying universal value Γ. We show, for example, that the PDMFs observed in a small (radius ∼200 pc) volume randomly placed at the solar circle have a ∼15-30 per cent likelihood of resulting in Γapp ≳ Γ + 0.35 because of inhomogeneities in the surface densities of more massive stars. If we add the a priori knowledge that the Sun currently lies in an interarm region, where the star formation rate is lower than the average at the solar circle, we find an even higher likelihood (∼ 50-60 per cent) of Γapp ≳ Γ + 0.35, corresponding to Γapp ≳ 1.7 when the underlying Γ = 1.35.},

	abstract = {No true extrasolar Earth analog is known. Hundreds of planets have been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the first time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We confirm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius. We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

The [Fe/H] of the recent episode supports an LMC origin for the Stream. The metallicity of the SMC supports star formation, {\textasciitilde}3 Gyr ago, as triggered by LMC interaction and sustained by the bar in the outer region of the galaxy. The SMC [Fe/H] agrees with the present-day abundance in the Bridge and shows no significant gradient. The metallicity of M33 supports an “inside-out” disc formation via accretion of metal poor gas from the interstellar medium.},

Combining our ultra-deep Subaru/Suprime-Cam z'- and y-band (λeff = 1 μm) images with legacy data of Subaru and Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxies down to y = 26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z = 6.96 determined from Lyα emission. The z = 7 luminosity function yields the best-fit Schechter parameters of phi* = 0.69+2.62 -0.55 × 10-3 Mpc-3, M*UV = -20.10 ± 0.76 mag, and α = -1.72 ± 0.65, and indicates a decrease from z = 6 at a {\textgreater}95\% confidence level. This decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our two fields, which is estimated to be a factor of lsim2. We have found that the cosmic star formation rate density drops from the peak at z = 2-3 to z = 7 roughly by a factor of {\textasciitilde}10 but not larger than {\textasciitilde}100. A comparison with the reionization models suggests either that the universe could not be totally ionized by only galaxies at z = 7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z = 7 are different from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction (gsim0.2), a lower metallicity, and/or a flatter initial mass function. Our SDF z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60 Mpc long filamentary structures, and the z = 6.96 galaxy with Lyα emission is located at the center of an overdense region consisting of four UV bright dropout candidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubble at z = 7.

	abstract = {With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys the amount of high quality chemodynamical data in the Milky Way (MW) increased tremendously. Accurately and correctly capturing and explaining the detailed features in the high-quality observational data is notoriously difficult for state-of-the-art numerical models. In order to keep up with the quantity and quality of observational data sets, improved prescriptions for galactic chemical evolution need to be incorporated into the simulations. Here we present a new, flexible, time-resolved chemical enrichment model for cosmological simulations. Our model allows us to easily change a number of stellar physics parameters such as the shape of the initial mass function (IMF), stellar lifetimes, chemical yields, or SN Ia delay times. We implement our model into the Gasoline2 code and perform a series of cosmological simulations varying a number of key parameters, foremost evaluating different stellar yield sets for massive stars from the literature. We find that total metallicity, total iron abundance, and gas phase oxygen abundance are robust predictions from different yield sets and in agreement with observational relations. On the other hand, individual element abundances, especially alpha-elements show significant differences across different yield sets and none of our models can simultaneously match constraints on the dwarf and MW mass scale. This offers a unique way of observationally constraining model parameters. For MW mass galaxies we find for most yield tables tested in this work a bimodality in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plane of rather low intrinsic scatter potentially in tension with the observed abundance scatter.},

	abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8\% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Ω*h=2.0+/-0.6×10-3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

	abstract = {We derive an analytical theory of the prestellar core initial mass function (IMF) based on an extension of the Press-Schechter statistical formalism. Our approach relies on the general concept of the gravothermal and gravoturbulent collapse of a molecular cloud, with a selection criterion based on the thermal or turbulent Jeans mass, which yields the derivation of the mass spectrum of self-gravitating objects in a quiescent or a turbulent environment. The same formalism also yields the mass spectrum of non-self-gravitating clumps produced in supersonic flows. The mass spectrum of the self-gravitating cores reproduces well the observed IMF. The theory predicts that the shape of the IMF results from two competing contributions, namely, a power law at large scales and an exponential cutoff (lognormal form) centered around the characteristic mass for gravitational collapse. The cutoff exists both in the case of thermal or turbulent collapse, provided that the underlying density field has a lognormal distribution. Whereas pure thermal collapse produces a power-law tail steeper than the Salpeter value, dN/dlog M propto M-x with x simeq 1.35, the latter is recovered exactly for the (three-dimensional) value of the spectral index of the velocity power spectrum, n simeq 3.8, found in observations and in numerical simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulence. Indeed, the theory predicts that x = (n + 1)/(2n - 4) for self-gravitating structures and x = 2 - n'/3 for non-self-gravitating structures, where n' is the power spectrum index of log ρ . We show that, whereas supersonic turbulence promotes the formation of both massive stars and brown dwarfs, it has an overall negative impact on star formation, decreasing the star formation efficiency. This theory provides a novel theoretical foundation to understand the origin of the IMF and provides useful guidance to numerical simulations exploring star formation, while making testable predictions.},

To date, observations have presented somewhat contradictory evidence relating to this issue. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Aims: In this paper we propose to derive the mass function of a complete sample of dense molecular cores in a single cloud employing a robust method that uses uses extinction of background starlight to measure core masses and enables the reliable extension of such measurements to lower masses than previously possible. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We use a map of near-infrared extinction in the nearby Pipe dark cloud to identify the population of dense cores in the cloud and measure their masses. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We identify 159 dense cores and construct the mass function for this population. We present the first robust evidence for a departure from a single power-law form in the mass function of a population of cores and find that this mass function is surprisingly similar in shape to the stellar IMF but scaled to a higher mass by a factor of about 3. This suggests that the distribution of stellar birth masses (IMF) is the direct product of the dense core mass function and a uniform star formation efficiency of 30\%±10\%, and that the stellar IMF may already be fixed during or before the earliest stages of core evolution. These results are consistent with previous dust continuum studies which suggested that the IMF directly originates from the core mass function. The typical density of {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} measured for the dense cores in this cloud suggests that the mass scale that characterizes the dense core mass function may be the result of a simple process of thermal (Jeans) fragmentation. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Table of core positions is only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/462/L17},

The codes share common initial conditions and common astrophysics packages including UV background, metal-dependent radiative cooling, metal and energy yields of supernovae, and stellar initial mass function. These are described in detail in the present paper. Subgrid star formation and feedback prescriptions will be tuned to provide a realistic interstellar and circumgalactic medium using a non-cosmological disk galaxy simulation. Cosmological runs will be systematically compared with each other using a common analysis toolkit and validated against observations to verify that the solutions are robust—i.e., that the astrophysical assumptions are responsible for any success, rather than artifacts of particular implementations. The goals of the AGORA project are, broadly speaking, to raise the realism and predictive power of galaxy simulations and the understanding of the feedback processes that regulate galaxy "metabolism." The initial conditions for the AGORA galaxies as well as simulation outputs at various epochs will be made publicly available to the community. The proof-of-concept dark-matter-only test of the formation of a galactic halo with a z = 0 mass of M vir {\textasciitilde}= 1.7 × 1011 M ⊙ by nine different versions of the participating codes is also presented to validate the infrastructure of the project.},

For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions (Mr=-19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2×1010 Msolar after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope (M*=-21.5, α=-0.8) compared to the blue distribution (α{\textasciitilde}-1.3, depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3×1010 Msolar. Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.},

Three recent promising secondary extragalactic distance indicators (Tully-Fisher, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and surface-brightness fluctuations) tie their zero points to the Cepheid distance scale and give globally consistent values for the Hubble constant of about 80 km sec{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} Mpc{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. Tying the Faber-Jackson relation and the supernova distance scales to the Leo and Virgo clusters yields similar results.

These bright Cepheids were observed with the WFC3 spatial scanning mode in the optical and near-infrared to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors to reach a mean photometric error of 5 mmag per observation. We use the new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and HST photometry to simultaneously constrain the cosmic distance scale and to measure the DR2 parallax zeropoint offset appropriate for Cepheids. We find the latter to be -46 ± 13 μas or ±6 μas for a fixed distance scale, higher than found from quasars, as expected for these brighter and redder sources. The precision of the distance scale from DR2 has been reduced by a factor of 2.5 because of the need to independently determine the parallax offset. The best-fit distance scale is 1.006 ± 0.033, relative to the scale from Riess et al. with H 0 = 73.24 km s-1 Mpc-1 used to predict the parallaxes photometrically, and is inconsistent with the scale needed to match the Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background data combined with ΛCDM at the 2.9σ confidence level (99.6\%). At 96.5\% confidence we find that the formal DR2 errors may be underestimated as indicated. We identify additional errors associated with the use of augmented Cepheid samples utilizing ground-based photometry and discuss their likely origins. Including the DR2 parallaxes with all prior distance-ladder data raises the current tension between the late and early universe route to the Hubble constant to 3.8σ (99.99\%). With the final expected precision from Gaia, the sample of 50 Cepheids with HST photometry will limit to 0.5\% the contribution of the first rung of the distance ladder to the uncertainty in H 0.},

It is found that the mean level of their Ca II H and K emission (averaged over 15 years) is correlated with rotation period, as expected. However, there is a further dependence of the emission on spectral type. When expressed as the ratio of chromospheric flux to total bolometric flux, the emission is well correlated with the parameter P(obs)/tau(c), where P(obs) is the observed rotation period and tau(c)(B - V) is a theoretically-derived convective overturn time, calculated assuming a mixing length to scale height ratio alpha of about 2. This finding is consonant with general predictions of dynamo theory, if the relation between chromospheric emission and dynamo-generated magnetic fields is essentially independent of rotation rate and spectral type for the stars considered. The dependence of mean chromospheric emission on rotation and spectral type is essentially the same for stars above and below the Vaughan-Preston (1980) 'gap', thus casting doubt on explanations of the gap in terms of a discontinuity in dynamo characteristics.},

We discuss the nucleosynthesis in the H-burning core of these objects and present the chemical composition of their ejecta. We consider the impact of uncertainties in the relevant nuclear reaction rates. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: Fast rotating stars reach critical velocity at the beginning of their evolution and remain near the critical limit during the rest of the main sequence and part of the He-burning phase. As a consequence they lose large amounts of material through a mechanical wind which probably leads to the formation of a slow outflowing disk. The material in this slow wind is enriched in H-burning products and presents abundance patterns similar to the chemical anomalies observed in globular cluster stars. In particular, the C, N, O, Na and Li variations are well reproduced by our model. However the rate of the {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}24{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}Mg(p,γ) has to be increased by a factor 1000 around 50 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} K in order to reproduce the amplitude of the observed Mg-Al anticorrelation. We discuss how the long-lived low-mass stars currently observed in globular clusters could have formed out of the slow wind material ejected by massive stars.},

Our automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods between 0.2 and 70 days for 34,030 (25.6\%) of the 133,030 main-sequence Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest sample of stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the detailed features of the now well-populated period-temperature distribution and demonstrate that the period bimodality, first seen by McQuillan et al. in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher masses, becoming less visible above 0.6 M ⊙. We show that these results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyr, based on the isochrones of Barnes, Mamajek, \& Hillenbrand and Meibom et al. We also performed a detailed comparison of our results to those of Reinhold et al. and Nielsen et al., who measured rotation periods of field stars observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability for the stars with detection rotation periods, and found a typical range between {\textasciitilde}950 ppm (5th percentile) and {\textasciitilde}22,700 ppm (95th percentile), with a median of {\textasciitilde}5600 ppm.

We also identify two clusters whose spin-axis distributions can be better described by a model consisting of an aligned fraction of stars combined with an isotropic distribution. However, the inclination values of these stars may be influenced by systematic error, and the small number of stars modeled as aligned in these two clusters precludes the interpretation that their stellar subsets are physically aligned. Overall, no cluster displays an unambiguous signature of spin alignment, and 97\% of the stars in our sample are consistent with isotropic orientations in their respective clusters. Our results offer support for the dominance of turbulence over ordered rotation in clumps and do not suggest the alignment of rotation axes and magnetic fields in protostars.},

Applying our membership analysis to the rotational sequences reveals that: (1) the contamination in clusters observed from the ground can reach up to {\textasciitilde}35\%; (2) the overall fraction of rotational outliers decreases substantially when the field contaminants are removed, but some outliers persist; (3) there is a sharp upper edge in the rotation periods at young ages; (4) at young ages, stars in the 1.0-0.6M ⊙ range inhabit a global maximum of rotation periods, potentially providing an optimal window for habitable planets. Additionally, we see clear evidence for a strongly mass-dependent spin-down process. In the regime where rapid rotators are leaving the saturated domain, the rotational distributions broaden (in contradiction with popular models), which we interpret as evidence that the torque must be lower for rapid rotators than for intermediate ones. The cleaned rotational sequences from ground-based observations can be as constraining as those obtained from space.},

In this paper, we use spectrophotometric observations of the open cluster NGC 2516 to determine the degree of spin alignment among its stars. We combine TESS light curves, ground-based spectroscopy from the Gaia-ESO and GALAH surveys, broadband stellar magnitudes from several surveys, and Gaia astrometry to measure 33 stellar inclinations and quantify overall cluster rotation. Our measurements suggest that stellar spins in this cluster are isotropically oriented, while allowing for the possibility that they are moderately aligned. An isotropic distribution of NGC 2516 spins would imply a star-forming environment in which turbulence dominated ordered motion, while a moderately aligned distribution would suggest a more substantial contribution from rotation. We also perform a three-dimensional analysis of the cluster's internal kinematics, finding no significant signatures of overall rotation. Stemming from this analysis, we identify evidence of cluster contraction, suggesting possible ongoing mass segregation in NGC 2516.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that this mass-rotation correlation is present in the 10 Myr Upper Scorpius association, as revealed by new K2 rotation measurements. Using rotational evolution models, we show that the low-mass rotation distribution of the 125 Myr Pleiades cluster can only be produced if it hosted an equally strong mass-rotation correlation at 10 Myr. This suggests that physical processes important in the early pre-main sequence (PMS; star formation, accretion, disk-locking) are primarily responsible for the M dwarf rotation morphology, and not quirks of later angular momentum (AM) evolution. Such early mass trends must be taken into account when constructing initial conditions for future studies of stellar rotation. Finally, we show that the average M star loses ∼25\%-40\% of its AM between 10 and 125 Myr, a figure accurately and generically predicted by modern solar-calibrated wind models. Their success rules out a lossless PMS and validates the extrapolation of magnetic wind laws designed for solar-type stars to the low-mass regime at early times.},

	abstract = {We propose a simple interpretation of the rotation period data for solar- and late-type stars. The open cluster and Mount Wilson star observations suggest that rotating stars lie primarily on two sequences, initially called I and C. Some stars lie in the intervening gap. These sequences, and the fractional numbers of stars on each sequence, evolve systematically with cluster age, enabling us to construct crude rotational isochrones allowing ``stellar gyrochronology,'' a procedure, on improvement, likely to yield ages for individual field stars. The age and color dependences of the sequences allow the identification of the underlying mechanism, which appears to be primarily magnetic. The majority of solar- and late-type stars possess a dominant Sun-like, or interface, magnetic field, which connects the convective envelope to both the radiative interior of the star and the exterior, where winds can drain off angular momentum. These stars spin down Skumanich style. An age-decreasing fraction of young G, K, and M stars, which are rapid rotators, possess only a convective field, which is not only inefficient in depleting angular momentum but also incapable of coupling the surface convection zone to the inner radiative zone, so that only the outer zone is spun down, and on an exponential timescale. These stars do not yet possess large-scale dynamos. The large-scale magnetic field associated with the dynamo, apparently created by the shear between the decoupled radiative and convective zones, (re)couples the convective and radiative zones and drives a star from the convective to the interface sequence through the gap on a timescale that increases as stellar mass decreases. Fully convective stars do not possess such an interface, cannot generate an interface dynamo, and hence can never make such a transition. Helioseismic results for the present-day Sun agree with this scheme, which also explains the rotational bimodality observed by Herbst and collaborators among pre-main-sequence stars and the termination of this bimodality when stars become fully convective. This paradigm also provides a new basis for understanding stellar X-ray and chromospheric activity, light-element abundances, and perhaps other stellar phenomena that depend on rotation.

This technique, called gyrochronology, derives ages for low-mass main-sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is developed here and used to derive ages for illustrative groups of nearby field stars with measured rotation periods. We first demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique possible, and extend it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period. Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at {\textasciitilde}15\% (plus possible systematic errors) for late F, G, K, and early M stars. Gyro ages for the Mount Wilson stars are shown to be in good agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main-sequence field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators. These are shown to have a median age of 365 Myr. The sample of single field stars assembled by Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed and shown to have gyro ages ranging from under 100 Myr to several Gyr, with a median age of 1.2 Gyr. Finally, we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries ξ Boo AB, 61 Cyg AB, and α Cen AB yield substantially the same gyro ages.},

We report rotation periods for 441 stars within this field and determine their cluster membership and binarity based on a decade-long radial velocity survey, proper-motion measurements, and multiband photometric observations. We find that 310 of the stars with measured rotation periods are late-type members of M35. The distribution of rotation periods for cluster members span more than 2 orders of magnitude from {\textasciitilde}0.1 to 15 days, not constrained by the sampling frequency and the timespan of the survey. With an age between the zero-age main sequence and the Hyades, and with {\textasciitilde}6 times more rotation periods than measured in the Pleiades, M35 permit detailed studies of early rotational evolution of late-type stars. Nearly 80\% of the 310 rotators lie on two distinct sequences in the color-period plane, and define clear relations between stellar rotation period and color (mass). The M35 color-period diagram enables us to determine timescales for the transition between the two rotational states, of {\textasciitilde}60 Myr and {\textasciitilde}140 Myr for G and K dwarfs, respectively. These timescales are inversely related to the mass of the convective envelope, and offer constraints on the rates of internal and external angular momentum transport and of the evolution of stellar dynamos. A comparison to the Hyades, confirm the Skumanich spin-down dependence for G dwarfs on one rotational state, but suggest that K dwarfs spin down more slowly. The locations of the rotational sequences in the M35 color-period diagram support the use of rotational isochrones to determine ages for coeval stellar populations. We use such gyrochronology to determine "gyro-ages" for M35 from 134 Myr to 161 Myr. We use the M35 data to evaluate new color dependences for the rotational isochrones. WIYN Open Cluster Study.

We investigate how the X-ray emissivity of fainter X-ray binaries (principally CVs and coronally active binaries) varies between different environments. We compile calculations (largely from the literature) of the X-ray emissivity of old stellar populations, including open and globular clusters and several galaxies. We investigate three literature claims of unusual X-ray sources in low-density stellar populations. We show that a suggested quiescent neutron star in the open cluster NGC 6819 is a foreground M dwarf. We show that the suggested diffuse X-ray emission from an old nova shell in the globular cluster NGC 6366 is actually a background galaxy cluster. And we show that a suggested population of quiescent X-ray binaries in the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy is mostly (perhaps entirely) background galaxies. We find that above densities of 104 M⊙ pc-3, the X-ray emissivity of globular clusters increases, due to dynamical production of X-ray emitting systems. Below this density, globular clusters have lower X-ray emissivity than the other populations, and we do not see a strong dependence of X-ray emissivity due to density effects. We find significant correlations between X-ray emissivity and binary fraction, metallicity, and density. Sampling these fits via bootstrap techniques gives less significant correlations, but confirms the effect of metallicity on low-density populations, and that of density on the full globular cluster sample.},

Using data from the Open Cluster Abundances and Mapping survey, based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 survey, we derive a new empirical relationship between open cluster stellar ages and the carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N]) abundance ratios for evolved stars, primarily those on the red giant branch. With this calibration, [C/N] can be used as a chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate the formation and evolution of different parts of our Galaxy. We explore how mixing effects at different stellar evolutionary phases, like the red clump, affect the derived calibration. We have established the [C/N]-age calibration for APOGEE Data Release 17 (DR17) giant star abundances to be \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\{[{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Age\}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\})]\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{DR\}17\}=10.14{\textbackslash},({\textbackslash}pm 0.08)+2.23({\textbackslash}pm 0.19){\textbackslash},[\{{\textbackslash}rm\{C\}\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm\{N\}\}]\$ , usable for \$8.62{\textbackslash}leqslant {\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{Age\}[{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}]){\textbackslash}leqslant 9.82\$ , derived from a uniform sample of 49 clusters observed as part of APOGEE DR17 applicable primarily to metal-rich, thin- and thick-disk giant stars. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 calibration is also shown to be consistent with asteroseismic ages derived from Kepler photometry.},

However, the precise shape and extent of this shell4,5, the impetus and timescale for its formation6,7, and its relationship to nearby star formation8 have remained uncertain, largely due to low-resolution models of the local interstellar medium. Here we report an analysis of the three-dimensional positions, shapes and motions of dense gas and young stars within 200 pc of the Sun, using new spatial9-11 and dynamical constraints12. We find that nearly all of the star-forming complexes in the solar vicinity lie on the surface of the Local Bubble and that their young stars show outward expansion mainly perpendicular to the bubble's surface. Tracebacks of these young stars' motions support a picture in which the origin of the Local Bubble was a burst of stellar birth and then death (supernovae) taking place near the bubble's centre beginning approximately 14 Myr ago. The expansion of the Local Bubble created by the supernovae swept up the ambient interstellar medium into an extended shell that has now fragmented and collapsed into the most prominent nearby molecular clouds, in turn providing robust observational support for the theory of supernova-driven star formation.},

We find after careful dereddening and by comparison with theoretical isochrones, that besides the Upper Scorpius the Upper Centaurus Lupus and Lower Centaurus Crux subgroups are the youngest stellar associations in the solar neighbourhood with ages of 20-30 Myr, in agreement with previous work. In search for the `smoking gun' of the origin of the LB, we have traced the paths of the associations back into the past and found that they entered the present bubble region 10-15 Myr ago. We argue that the LB began to form then and estimate that 14-20 SNe have gone off since. It is shown that the implied energy input is sufficient to excavate a bubble of the presently observed size.},

Here we describe the first otolith-based fish fauna from the Neogene of India and the entire Indian Ocean, from the Burdigalian (Quilon Formation) of Kerala, southern India. The faunal composition is dominated by the Apogonidae and Gobiidae. The depositional environment is interpreted as a seagrass meadow in a sheltered back-reef environment, less than 10 m water depth, with no open marine influence, and possibly with mangroves on land. Some shared faunal elements observed in the Gobiidae with the coeval western Tethys and Paratethys suggest a possible faunal exchange during the late stages of the Tethyan Seaway. Coeval faunas from Indonesia (Java and Borneo) also show shared faunal elements, thus indicating that the typical Indo-West Pacific fish fauna was firmly established in the Burdigalian, at least for the Apogonidae and Gobiidae. The Quilon fauna is more diverse in Apogonidae than in any other contemporary region, and this aspect is briefly discussed with respect to the tropical Neogene marine diversity development. A total of 29 otolith-based taxa have been identified in the Quilon Formation, of which the following 11 species are described as new to science: Jaydia? quilonica, Siphamia minor, Fibramia keralensis, Acentrogobius matsya, Ancistrogobius indicus, Drombus thackerae, Gobiodon burdigalicus, Amblyeleotris kireedam, Fusigobius? venadicus, Cirripectes biconvexus, and Callionymus vyali.},

	abstract = {This study provides a comprehensive and quantitative estimate of how global temperatures have changed during the last 540 million years. It combines paleotemperature measurements determined from oxygen isotopes with broader insights obtained from the changing distribution of lithologic indicators of climate, such as coals, evaporites, calcretes, reefs, and bauxite deposits. The waxing and waning of the Earth’s great polar icecaps have been mapped using the past distribution of tillites, dropstones, and glendonites. The global temperature model presented here includes estimates of global average temperate (GAT), changing tropical temperatures (∆T° tropical), deep ocean temperatures, and polar temperatures. Though similar, in many respects, to the temperature history deduced directly from the study of oxygen isotopes, our model does not predict the extreme high temperatures for the Early Paleozoic required by isotopic investigations. The history of global changes in temperature during the Phanerozoic has been summarized in a “paleotemperature timescale” that subdivides the many past climatic events into 8 major climate modes; each climate mode is made up of 3-4 pairs of warming and cooling episodes (chronotemps). A detailed narrative describes how these past temperature events have been affected by geological processes such as the eruption of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPS) (warming) and bolide impacts (cooling). The paleotemperature model presented here allows for a deeper understanding of the interconnected geologic, tectonic, paleoclimatic, paleoceanographic, and evolutionary events that have shaped our planet, and we make explicit predictions about the Earth’s past temperature that can be tested and evaluated. By quantitatively describing the pattern of paleotemperature change through time, we may be able to gain important insights into the history of the Earth System and the fundamental causes of climate change on geological timescales. These insights can help us better understand the problems and challenges that we face as a result of Future Global Warming.},

	abstract = {Modeling the Local Bubble is one of those activities fraught with danger. It is very easy to be too naive, to fail to consider the dependence of the model on assumptions about the nearby ambient state, or the likelihood of such a structure. It is similarly easy to become so caught up in the details of the vicinity that it is unclear where to begin a necessarily idealized modeling effort. And finally, it is important to remember that the data we have may in some cases be lying to us, and that we have not yet learned to read their facial expressions quite carefully enough. That said, I've tried in this paper to be helpful to those who may wish to take the risks. I surveyed the very most basic stories that the data seem to tell, and pointed out the standard coincidences that may be telling us a lot about what is happening, but may turn out once again to have been just coincidences. I've described 5 distinct conceptions that in one flavor or another pretty well survey the collection of mental images that have so far been carried by those who've attempted models. One may be right, or something entirely different may be more appropriate. It's at least vital to realize that a conception comes first, followed by a simplified model of details. I've also included a long list of questions directed at observers. Some have partial answers, some one wouldn't know today quite how to approach. But it is a list that students of the soft x-ray background, interstellar absorption lines, possible instrumentation, and the heliosphere may wish to review from time to time, just to see whether they can figure out how to be more helpful. There is another list for modelers, things the models must address, however-so-flimsily if necessary, because there are strong observational constraints (and stronger ones coming) on what can and cannot be present in the local ISM. To that I've added a few remarks concerning x-ray emission coming from beyond the Local Bubble, and another few on how x-ray emission from within the solar system might be contaminating what we see. That last bit is new, exciting, and possibly wrong, but it is an example of the ongoing wariness I believe one has to take toward the facts in the case.

	abstract = {This paper examines the possibility that a series of two or three supernovae in the diffuse interstellar medium might be capable of generating a long-lived hot diffuse bubble with characteristics like those inferred for the Local Bubble surrounding the Sun. Several examples of multiple supernova remnants are explored with a one-dimensional hydrocode able to follow the nonequilibrium ionization and dust destruction. The results are generalized via scaling parameters, and a set of input parameters are identified, which should in fact lead to a bubble satisfying all known constraints on size, external pressure, external density, X-ray surface brightness and band ratios, the upper limit to X-ray emission in the 0.5-1 keV range, and the O VI absorption line characteristics. The exploratory models are a unique example of the detailed behavior of hot interstellar bubbles, and their characteristics are presented in considerable detail. Included are the distributions of temperature, density, and pressure, as well as the evolutions of those distributions with time, the evolution of bubble radius during both expansion and contraction, the evolution of the X-ray emission in observed bands and specific observed lines, a diagnostic for normalizing the X-ray surface brightness to radius, pressure, and central temperature, the radial dependence of X-ray emissivity, the full X-ray and EUV spectrum, the equivalent widths of potentially observable absorption lines, the specific characteristics of the O VI absorption (column density, centroid velocity, width), the electron column density, the emission line intensities for O VI, Fe X, and Fe XIV, the degree to which dust can be expected to have been destroyed, and the effects of incomplete dust destruction on everything else. Observations have shown that the emission lines of iron from the Local Bubble are weak or absent. This is somewhat surprising, since considerable grain destruction is expected, even if only by thermal sputtering. The result is similar to other hints that much of the iron is in its own population of dust and is very resistant to destruction. In our models, having iron alone depleted by a factor of 10 makes it much easier to accommodate the X-ray emission characteristics. Having a successful model also requires that thermal conduction within the hot bubble occurs at roughly half of its full classical rate. For substantially lower thermal conductivity, the temperature is too high to get the spectral characteristics right, and the density is too low at the highest allowed pressure to achieve the observed brightness. Our fiducial model assumes that three supernovae took place in the vicinity of the Sun over a period of 3 million years, the last having occurred a few million years ago. We show that such accidental occurrences should be sufficiently common to provide about 1 chance in 30 (with considerable uncertainty) of being found within one. Certainly supernovae occur outside of OB associations, and direct evidence for a nearby supernova some 5 million years ago that could have been responsible for the latest reheating of the Local Bubble has recently been found in the excess abundance of 60Fe in a deep ocean ferromanganese crust.},

The mean absorption coefficient of the interstellar medium for photons near 0.28 keV agrees with the theoretically expected value for a uniform absorbing medium and a normal Heill abundance ratio.

A comparison at constant galactic latitude of both C band and B band (about 0.1-0.18 keV) soft X-ray data with neutral-hydrogen maps shows that the intensity does decrease with increasing neutral-hydrogen column density but in a manner that is inconsistent with photoelectric absorption. It is suggested that the inverse correlation is a displacement effect. X-ray emission regions appear to be where the cool gas is not. Further, the evidence against photoelectric absorption implies that the bulk of the cool gas is beyond the X-ray emitting regions. Fewer than 10 to the 20th power H atoms per sq cm can be between the sun and the X-ray emitting regions. The sun appears to be surrounded by a soft X-ray emission region consisting of gas at a temperature of about 1 million K.},

The velocity (V∼-20 km s-1 froml∼335°,b∼0° in the local standard of rest) and enhanced Ca ii and Fe ii abundances of this cloud suggest an origin as evaporated gas from cloud surfaces in the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. Although the soft X-ray emission attributed to the ‘Local Bubble’ is enigmatic, optical and ultraviolet data are consistent with bubble formation caused by star formation epochs in the Scorpius-Centaurus Association as regulated by the nearby spiral arm configuration. The cloud surrounding the solar system (the ‘local fluff’) appears to be the leading region of an expanding interstellar structure (the ‘squall line’) which contains a magnetic field causing polarization of the light of nearby stars, and also absorption features in nearby upwind stars. The velocity vectors of the solar system and local fluff are perpendicular in the local standard of rest. Combining this information with the low column densities seen towards Sirius in the anti-apex direction, and the assumption that the cloud velocity vector is parallel to the surface normal, suggests that the Sun entered the local fluff within the historical past (less than 10 000 years ago) and is skimming the surface of the cloud. Comparison of magnesium absorption lines towards Sirius and anomalous cosmic-ray data suggest the local fluff is in ionization equilibrium.},

Primarily designed to detect planetary transits and asteroseismological signals from solar-like stars, Kepler has provided high-quality data for many areas of investigation. Unconditioned simple aperture time-series photometry is, however, affected by systematic structure. Examples of these systematics include differential velocity aberration, thermal gradients across the spacecraft, and pointing variations. While exhibiting some impact on Kepler’s primary science, these systematics can critically handicap potentially ground-breaking scientific gains in other astrophysical areas, especially over long timescales greater than 10 days. As the data archive grows to provide light curves for 105 stars of many years in length, Kepler will only fulfill its broad potential for stellar astrophysics if these systematics are understood and mitigated. Post-launch developments in the Kepler archive, data reduction pipeline and open source data analysis software have helped to remove or reduce systematic artifacts. This paper provides a conceptual primer to help users of the Kepler data archive understand and recognize systematic artifacts within light curves and some methods for their removal. Specific examples of artifact mitigation are provided using data available within the archive. Through the methods defined here, the Kepler community will find a road map to maximizing the quality and employment of the Kepler legacy archive.},

The calculation of the modified periodogram for unevenly sampled data is reviewed. The proper definition of the variance that is used to normalize the power of the modified periodogram is clarified. It is proven that the probability that a peak in the periodogram is noise or signal can be easily assessed by the method given here only when the total variance of the data is used to normalize the periodogram power. The crucial choice of independent frequencies in calculating both the periodogram and the false alarm probability from unevenly sampled data is discussed. An empirical formula for estimating the number of independent frequencies is derived. In addition, the formula for the uncertainty of a frequency identified in the periodogram is reviewed. A method for detecting the presence of an alias frequency caused by the interaction of the window and signal is prescribed. With some examples of periodic signals, the minimum number of points required to measure reliably a signal are shown. The signal-to-noise ratio and the number of points required to extract signals when one or two periodicities are present in the time series are investigated.},

Our aims are to discover giant transiting planets with known ages, and to provide light curves suitable for studies in stellar astrophysics. For this work, we made 159,343 light curves of candidate young stars, across 596 distinct clusters. Each light curve represents between 20 and 25 days of observations of a star brighter than G Rp = 16, with 30-minute sampling. We describe the image-subtraction and time-series analysis techniques we used to create the light curves, which have noise properties that agree with theoretical expectations. We also comment on the possible utility of the light-curve sample for studies of stellar rotation evolution and binary eccentricity damping.

In this work, we present our project `A PSF-based Approach to TESS High quality data Of Stellar clusters' (PATHOS), aimed at searching and characterize candidate exoplanets and variable stars in stellar clusters using our innovative method for the extraction of high-precision light curves of stars located in crowded environments. Our technique of light-curve extraction involves the use of empirical point spread functions (PSFs), an input catalogue and neighbour-subtraction. The PSF-based approach allows us to minimize the dilution effects in crowded environments and to extract high-precision photometry for stars in the faint regime (G {\textgreater} 13). For this pilot project, we extracted, corrected, and analysed the light curves of 16 641 stars located in a dense region centred on the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We were able to reach the TESS magnitude T ∼ 16.5 with a photometric precision of \{∼\} 1\{\{ per cent\}\} on the 6.5-h time-scale; in the bright regime we were able to detect transits with depth of ∼34 parts per million. We searched for variables and candidate transiting exoplanets. Our pipeline detected one planetary candidate orbiting a main-sequence star in the Galactic field. We analysed the period-luminosity distribution for red-giant stars of 47 Tuc and the eclipsing binaries in the field.

Reliable P-A graphs for Galactic Cepheids constructed for the U, B, V, R\_C, and I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}C{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} photometric bands and pulsational radial velocity variations facilitate investigations of previously poorly studied interrelations between observable amplitudes. The effects of both binarity and metallicity on the observed amplitude, and the dichotomy between short- and long-period Cepheids can both be studied. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: A homogeneous data set was created that contains basic physical and phenomenological properties of 369 Galactic Cepheids. Pulsation periods were revised and amplitudes were determined by the Fourier method. P-A graphs were constructed and an upper envelope to the data points was determined in each graph. Correlations between various amplitudes and amplitude-related parameters were searched for, using Cepheids without known companions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: Large amplitude Cepheids with companions exhibit smaller photometric amplitudes on average than solitary ones, as expected, while s-Cepheids pulsate with an arbitrary (although small) amplitude. The ratio of the observed radial velocity to blue photometric amplitudes, A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}V\_RAD{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/A\_B, is not as good an indicator of the pulsation mode as predicted theoretically. This may be caused by an incorrect mode assignment to a number of small amplitude Cepheids, which are not necessarily first overtone pulsators. The dependence of the pulsation amplitudes on wavelength is used to identify duplicity of Cepheids. More than twenty stars previously classified as solitary Cepheids are now suspected to have a companion. The ratio of photometric amplitudes observed in various bands confirms the existence of a dichotomy among normal amplitude Cepheids. The limiting period separating short- and long-period Cepheids is 10.47 days. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: Interdependences of pulsational amplitudes, the period dependence of the amplitude parameters, and the dichotomy have to be taken into account as constraints in modelling the structure and pulsation of Cepheids.

The improvements in the precision of the published data in Gaia EDR3 with respect to Gaia DR2, particularly for parallaxes and proper motions, offer the opportunity to increase the number of known open clusters in the Milky Way by detecting farther and fainter objects that have thus far gone unnoticed.

We use Gaia EDR3 up to magnitude G = 18 mag, increasing the magnitude limit and therefore the search volume explored in one unit with respect to our previous studies. Methods: We used the OCfinder method to search for new open clusters in Gaia EDR3 using a big data environment. As a first step, OCfinder identified stellar statistical overdensities in five-dimensional astrometric space (position, parallax, and proper motions) using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Then, these overdensities were classified into random statistical overdensities or real physical open clusters using a deep artificial neural network trained on well-characterised G, GBP - GRP colour-magnitude diagrams. Results: We report the discovery of 628 new open clusters within the Galactic disc, with most of them being located beyond 1 kpc from the Sun. From the estimation of ages, distances, and line-of-sight extinctions of these open clusters, we see that young clusters align following the Galactic spiral arms while older ones are dispersed in the Galactic disc. Furthermore, we find that most open clusters are located at low Galactic altitudes with the exception of a few groups older than 1 Gyr. Conclusions: We show the success of the OCfinder method leading to the discovery of a total of 1274 open clusters (joining the discoveries here with the previous ones based on Gaia DR2), which represents almost 50\% of the known population. Our ability to perform big data searches on a large volume of the Galactic disc, together with the higher precision in Gaia EDR3, enable us to keep completing the census with the discovery of new open clusters.

On solar-like stars, more energetic stellar flares (superflares) have been observed, and it is of interest to determine whether the observed rates of superflare occurrence exhibit similar variability to solar flares. We analyze 274 G-type stars using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and identify seven stars which exhibit statistically significant changes in the rate of superflare occurrence by fitting a piecewise constant-rate model with the Bayesian blocks algorithm. We investigate the properties of these stars and their flaring rates, and discuss the possible reasons for the low number of stars with detectable rate variation.},

The components differ in color and luminosity, with component a brighter and redder than b by 007 mag in V and B - V. The observed ratio of the periods is Pa/Pb = 1.15, whereas the value predicted from Pp1!2 = Q using the photometric observations is Pa/Pb = 1.16 Â± 0.04, where the variation of Q across the instability strip is taken into account. The effect on the period-luminosity-color relation of a variation of Q of the form {\textasciitilde} logQ = Ii E{\textasciitilde}(B - V) + k{\textasciitilde} log P is shown to have no effect on our previous calibration. Galactic Cepheids in clusters and associations give the P-L-C relations, M({\textasciitilde}) = -3.425 log P + 2.52 ((B )Â° - (V {\textgreater}0) - 2.459, and M(B) = -3.425 log P + 3.52 ((B )Â° - (V )Â°) - 2.459, which reproduce the observed M{\textasciitilde} values for the thirteen calibrating stars to within Â± 0.064 mag average deviation. These equations represent a correction of -O 05 mag to the previous calibration. Expressions for the instability strip in the (Mr, B - V)-plane for galactic Cepheids are given. If perturbing effects, such as rotation, mass loss, and different main-sequence formation times, are excluded, the mass ratio of the more massive component to the less massive one must be less than 9){\textasciitilde}1/9J{\textasciitilde}2 = 1.007 if both stars are to be simultaneously within the Cepheid instability strip near M{\textasciitilde} {\textasciitilde} -3. This stringent requirement on the initial mass ratio will be relaxed if such perturbations affect the evolutionary tracks},

	abstract = {Integrated-light spectroscopy has been obtained for 27 globular clusters at the Ca II IR triplet. Line strengths and radial velocities have been measured from the spectra. For the well-studied clusters in the sample, the strength of the Ca II lines is very well correlated with previous metallicity estimates. Thus, the triplet is useful as a metallicity indicator in globular cluster integrated-light spectra. The greatly reduced effect of interstellar extinction at these wavelengths (compared to the blue region of the spectrum) has permitted observations of some of the most heavily reddened clusters in the Galaxy. For several such clusters, the Ca II triplet metallicities are in poor agreement with metallicity estimates from IR photometry by Malkan (1981). The strength of an interstellar band at 8621A has been used to estimate the amount of extinction towards these clusters. Using the new metallicity and radial-velocity data, the metallicity distribution, kinematics, and spatial distribution of the disk globular cluster system have been analyzed. Results very similar to those of Zinn (1985) have been found. The relation of the disk globulars to the stellar thick disk is discussed.},

	abstract = {One of the key mysteries of star formation is the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The IMF is observed to be nearly universal in the Milky Way and its satellites, and significant variations are only inferred in extreme environments, such as the cores of massive elliptical galaxies and the Central Molecular Zone. In this work, we present simulations from the STARFORGE project that are the first cloud-scale radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations that follow individual stars and include all relevant physical processes. The simulations include detailed gas thermodynamics, as well as stellar feedback in the form of protostellar jets, stellar radiation, winds, and supernovae. In this work, we focus on how stellar radiation, winds, and supernovae impact star-forming clouds. Radiative feedback plays a major role in quenching star formation and disrupting the cloud; however, the IMF peak is predominantly set by protostellar jet physics. We find that the effect of stellar winds is minor, and supernovae 'occur too late' to affect the IMF or quench star formation. We also investigate the effects of initial conditions on the IMF. We find that the IMF is insensitive to the initial turbulence, cloud mass, and cloud surface density, even though these parameters significantly shape the star formation history of the cloud, including the final star formation efficiency. Meanwhile, the characteristic stellar mass depends weakly on metallicity and the interstellar radiation field, which essentially set the average gas temperature. Finally, while turbulent driving and the level of magnetization strongly influence the star formation history, they only influence the high-mass slope of the IMF.},
