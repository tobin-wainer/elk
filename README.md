    This package allows you to download, correct, analyze and visualize <i>integrated</i> light curves from TESS FFI data using the methods outlined in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu">Wainer+2023</a>. While originally designed for analysis of star clusters, it can be used to create integrated light curves for any given aperture.
