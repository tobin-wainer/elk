Welcome to the **E**\ nsemble **L**\ ight\ **K**\ urve Python package, or simply ``elk``!

This package allows you to download, correct, analyze and visualize *ensemble* light curves from TESS FFI data using the methods outlined in `Wainer+2023 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/>`_. While originally designed for analysis of star clusters, it can be used to create ensemble light curves for any given aperture.

Use the links below to learn how to install ``elk``, explore different features in our detailed tutorials or peruse our exhaustive API documentation. We're excited to see how you will apply ``elk`` to your own work!

We'd also like to acknowledge the absolutely splendid work of `Samantha-Lynn Martinez <https://www.samanthalynnmartinez.com/>`_ in designing the ``elk`` logo. You can find more of her portfolio `here <https://www.samanthalynnmartinez.com/illustrationdesign>`_ and we encourage you to reach out to her for any design needs you have!
